        IMPORTANT RULES FOR FEEDBACK:
        1. ONLY use quotation marks around the student's quoted sentence, but NEVER use quotation marks in your feedback portion (after the ‚Äì).
        2. Example of what NOT to do: - "Quote" ‚Äì Feedback "with quotes" is bad
        3. Example of correct format: - "Quote" ‚Äì Feedback without quotes is good
        4. NEVER just write [the word] or [the phrase] without context.

        Focus your inline feedback on:
        - Sentences that could be clarified or rewritten
        - Tone, evidence, or phrasing issues
        - Claims that are unsupported or overly strong

        IMPORTANT RULES FOR RUBRIC FEEDBACK:
        - Only comment on real rubric sections listed.
        - Do not invent new section names.
        - Do not merge sections together.

        FINAL REMINDERS:

    Provide at least 4 inline comments total, but no more than 10.
    As a general guideline, aim for around 2‚Äì3 comments per 400 words of student writing.

    Use this format for each comment:
    - "Quoted student sentence" ‚Äì Feedback without quotes in the comment.

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. Only use quotation marks around the student quote.
    2. NEVER use quotation marks in the feedback itself ‚Äî instead, use karats: ^^like this^^.
    3. Do NOT write just ‚Äú[the word]‚Äù or vague markers. Be clear and specific.
    4. Do NOT correct minor grammar or word choice unless it directly impacts meaning.

    FOCUS AREAS:
    - The strength and clarity of the student's claims
    - The effectiveness of structure, flow, or logic
    - How well evidence supports key points
    - Argument gaps, assumptions, or lack of support

    Avoid nitpicking grammar or uncommon word choices unless they affect clarity. Mirror the tone and depth of the instructor feedback in the examples.

    --- SUMMARY FEEDBACK ---
    Write 2‚Äì3 paragraphs that reflect the instructor‚Äôs tone. Highlight what the student does well and clearly note areas to improve. Keep the tone constructive but firm.

    --- RUBRIC FEEDBACK ---
    Include rubric comments for ONLY 1‚Äì2 sections.
    Use the exact section names from the rubric above.

    Rubric Format:
    == [Project Portion] ==
    - Feedback comment 1
    - Feedback comment 2

    Do NOT invent new rubric categories or merge sections together.
    
    FORMATTING RULES:
    - No Markdown, no emojis, no numbered lists.
    - Maintain consistent structure and headers.
    
    Careful adherence to this format is required to receive full evaluation points.

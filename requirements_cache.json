Here\u2019s why:\n\n    Photos from Space: Satellites and astronauts have taken countless images of Earth from space, showing a round planet. These aren't faked\u2014satellites depend on accurate physics to stay in orbit, which only works with a spherical Earth.\n\n    Gravity: Gravity pulls everything toward the center of mass. On a flat Earth, gravity would pull at weird angles the farther you got from the center, causing water to slope and buildings to lean. That\u2019s not what happens.\n\n    Time Zones: The planet has time zones because it rotates. On a flat Earth, explaining why it\u2019s noon in one place and midnight in another at the same time doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n    Airplane Flights: Planes follow curved routes (great circles) because that\u2019s the shortest distance on a sphere. If the Earth were flat, flight paths would look different\u2014many long-haul flights in the Southern Hemisphere make zero sense on flat Earth maps.\n\n    Ships Disappearing Over the Horizon: Ships don\u2019t just get smaller as they sail away; they disappear bottom first. This only makes sense if the surface they\u2019re sailing on curves downward.\n\n    The Earth's Shadow on the Moon: During lunar eclipses, Earth casts a round shadow on the moon. It\u2019s always round, no matter the angle. Only a sphere always casts a circular shadow.\n\n    Coriolis Effect: Weather patterns and ocean currents behave differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres because Earth is spinning. This wouldn\u2019t happen on a flat, stationary plane.\n\nPeople figured this out over 2,000 years ago. Eratosthenes measured shadows in two cities and calculated Earth's circumference with surprising accuracy.\n\nFlat Earth arguments ignore basic physics, geometry, and empirical evidence."}

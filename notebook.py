# Main Feedback Generation Notebook
This notebook handles preprocessing, model interaction, and feedback generation.

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# Mount Google Drive (optional, you'll get a prompt to authorize account)

<br>*each of our classes will be what will merge to this notebook (im p sure)*
<br>only loads what you explicitly request

**--Lauren's bit that can run the feedback generator here to test**
- ended up modularizing code to prepare for gradio/UI use.
  - had all files include ability to user uploaded files, used local testing files as default to be able to test
  - created feedback_engine file to be ablet to create runnable program in notebook to test
  - TODO:: create runable feedback programe for Gradio/UI when that time comes

# Stuff to work towards

- [ ] look into docx files and how to process information

- [ ] Process data
    - [ ] Find what format we want to use for data processing
    - [ ] grab inline feedback
    - [ ] grab rubric
        - [ ] grab rubric feedback
        - [ ] color coding (?) and figure out how to extract this data from the end
    - [ ] annotate inline comments by category (e.g., clarity, argument strength, grammar).



- [ ] and regroup with what we found

-----------------
- Train model 
- Use the model to train 
  - LLama 3.2 (3 / 1 billion param) - 
  - Phi-2


------------
- [ ] compare inline feedbacks between submission progressions

- [ ] Have model create documents with the inline feedback/rubric/(rubricfeedback?)
- 
- [ ] (ignore now) Store feedback into CSV or something accessible for teachers

- Update the UI to support more than one model 
- Multiple inline feedbacks (3-5)

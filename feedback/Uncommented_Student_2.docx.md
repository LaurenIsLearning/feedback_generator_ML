Purpose of a Mask Mandate

If you are reading this article in 2021, chances are you are aware of what a mask mandate is. As a virus has swept the nation for the past two years, people were required to wear a mask at most locations. In my article, I will be discussing the pandemic and how people feel overall about the precautions that came with it. What is the purpose of a mask mandate?

Over the last couple of years, a mask mandate has been reintroduced nationwide, specifically, April 3rd 2020 according to the CDC. When the mask mandate was put into play at this time, all people the aged two years or older were required to wear a facial mask if in public and or within six feet of anyone in contact.

A mask is a covering for the nose and mouth used typically to prevent the spread of infections like a virus or bacteria. A mandate is an order given by some type of superior court that is enforced and meant to be followed and or obeyed. Combining these two definitions, a mask mandate is an enforcement of a mask given by a higher up that absolutely must be followed.

> This is the least objective way to explain a mask mandate because it seems like you believe the purpose is still disputed. Make sure you clarify your points in your last paragraph that the mandate is still in effect before moving on.

Though, this is not the first time a mask mandate has hit the nation. The first mask mandate was the influenza pandemic of 1918 and 1919. Coming from History.com this was a deadly flu outbreak killing up to fifty million people worldwide. To try and stop this spread, governments closed schools and required people to wear masks in public. Comparing this to now, starting in April of 2020 a mask mandate was put in act because of a virus called COVID 19. Schools were closed and people were required to wear masks. Both, similar if not identical situations.

> This is a useful comparison to make because it shows that masks have come to the rescue before, and it will undoubtedly happen again. The only difference between the two pandemics was the origin of the virus. One could see this as a positive or a negative depending on one’s perspective. Many would argue that had the CDC made the mask mandate nationwide when Covid 19 hit, it would have been better prepared for the virus. I do believe that using masks would have been a best option, although being unable to install masks in the United States has been a problem for many.

Some people were all for this idea, and some completely disagreed stating the mandate went against their constitutional rights. There are articles stating why masks absolutely should be worn such as Michigan Health summarizing why a mask mandate is necessary and fair for keeping yourself and others safe. Though, there are also articles such as The Conservation explaining why some people cannot wear a mask. Summarizing, a person with a disability such as cerebral palsy who have limited mobility which makes them unable to even put the strings over their ears.

> This is all summary, which is not good. Keep it to no more than 100 words.

Even today, in November of 2021, you may still see people walking around with masks on, though, they are not required by the CDC anymore, there are still locations such as colleges that require the use of a mask. You will still see this because the pandemic is absolutely still happening. December 11th of 2020, the first vaccine was given. This vaccine was meant to help the side effects if you did contract the virus and hopefully ultimately protect from getting the virus. Some believe masks are still important to wear to prevent breakthrough cases, especially if you are not wanting and or comfortable with getting the vaccine.

Starting with What the science says about lifting mask mandates the CDC stopped the mask mandate rule, but only under certain conditions. They announced that fully vaccinated individuals did not have to wear a mask, but that puts Erin Perkins, owner of a shop in New Hampshire in an uncomfortable position. This leaves her having to trust each person who walks in her shop without a mask is fully vaccinated which Erin thought was a major issue regarding her safety and everyone else's as well.


> **Dr. H**:

> This could be development. Keep developing it.

Overall, the article “What the science says about lifting mask mandates,” states the evidence is clear masks cut down on deaths related to covid 19, and as people continue to not wear masks, the infection rates increase. The article also states statistics showing masks protect not only people wearing masks, but the people around. This is particularly important regarding Erins concerns, as she does not feel comfortable with unmasked individuals in her shop as the statistics provided shows data proving her case. This is overall a strong article considering the author shows the position Erin is in, fear, which many other businesses can likely relate to.


> **Dr. H**:

> Nice analysis.

Erin Perkins point is very valid. If she does not feel comfortable with people in her shop without a mask, then she should be able to enforce masks, which is exactly how it still is today. Overall, if customers do not agree, then they can go elsewhere. Many readers will see this as valid considering many out of most people want the pandemic to end, and as far as we know, wearing a mask or getting vaccinated may possible be the only way. Today, being November of 2021, not often do you see places that still enforced masks, but only encourage.


> **Dr. H**:

> This is a pretty good point to make, but it doesn’t belong in this section of the project. The summary and background should be about the masks not wearing. This part says what the statement was about. It means you have two sentences that repeat each other. I don’t see where the repetition has gone on.

For my second article New mask guidelines are about politics and control this article is about the vaccine that was given to us December 11th, 2020. According to Carlson, individuals were told if they got the vaccine, they would be protected and not have to wear a mask. Also, according to Carlson, the Biden administration eventually went against their word claiming even if you are vaccinated, you will still have to participate in mask wearing. This made many Americans upset, as they were told one thing, and then given another.


> **Dr. H**:

> The Biden administration claimed they were giving people the option of choosing to wear a mask. That information was not available to the public at the time the vaccine was given. The purpose of the mandate was to protect people from the virus, not explain it to the public or give them options. The article “What the science says about lifting mask mandates,” states the evidence is clear masks cut down on deaths related to covid 19, and as people continue to not wear masks, the infection rates increase. This is a very valid point because it is a matter of debate how much to wear a mask, and this article brings it up. Many people still do not know if they should be wearing a mask. This article is trying to get the public educated in doing the most good to protect themselves.

The article states “Millions of Americans who’ve already recovered from COVID don’t need the vaccine. They have natural immunity to the virus,” but people are still being pushed to wear masks and get the vaccine. This is not a strong point made, as Carlson does not provide any proof of this.


> **Dr. H**:

> It’s a matter of debate exactly how many people actually got the COVID vaccine. The article you link is arguing the point that people don’t get it. The article you recommend reading is supporting. I’ve seen both sides argued. It’s true that many people don’t know what to do. On the Biden side, they’re trying to encourage people to wear masks and get the vaccine. On the Trump side, they don’t want to encourage people to wear masks, so they don’t give them the option to choose.

This article continues to push the emotion of fear Americans are gaining, as they feel as if they cannot trust what they are being told. People are starting to feel helpless knowing they are following what they are being told, and then what they were promised is not being presented fairly. People believe this has not turned into helping people, but more of a political control thing. Readers will feel scared and angry by this, as Carlson states what he sees happening.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> But what does Carlson say about the vaccine?

It is clear that the people are not only scared, they are angry. The quote “like they used to do in America back when it was a free country,” clearly states this claim. People are starting to feel helpless, though there is nothing they can do. As America is a free country, when not being told the full truth from the start, the article summarizes these defeats the purpose of being free, getting the vaccine, wearing masks when fully vaccinated.

> Read the first sentence in this portion I’ve commented on  (The first paragraph) and the last one (The last paragraph) and you’ll see the repetition. Get rid of one of them to make your summary and subsequent observations stronger.

For my last article, “As mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks,” This article summarizes the fears people are still having regarding mask wearing, and that they think it is dangerous for their children to have the option to wear masks. Cobb Schooling and one other school were the only schools in Atlanta that gave students the option to wear masks. This article continues to talk about their two-week case numbers saying with the masks being optional, the two-week case numbers nearly tripled. While this is a strong point, by not supplying the reader with the evidence it is harder to believe.

> Two weeks is too short a time to make a point about case numbers.

Charis Granger-Mbugua is a mother who is terrified for what might happen. Charis starts by explaining how nice it is to send your kids to schools, knowing they are being cared for and getting the education they need. The excitement the students used to have when going to school, not having a care in the world. This has changed for the perspective of the parents. Charis is sending her children to school with what she says is “feelings of fear, worry, guilt, confusion, frustration, anger, and even impending doom loomed large and undeniable,” and as a mother, this is the last thing Charis is wanting to feel regarding sending her children to a place that is supposed to be a safe spot. Charis is using strong emotion, by providing the information that she is a mother, it is likely other mothers will strongly agree with her after reading this article.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> This is all saying what the article says. That’s summary. It means you have only two sentences of analysis out of these two paragraphs.

Charis has a son in second grade, and a daughter aged 4. As her son was doing virtual learning the year before, sending him to school in person was okay for her because of the information she had known. Rates were going down, but as time went on, that had not been the case anymore.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> This is a pretty good response to the idea that virtual learning is not safe.

Starting with the article “What science says about lifting mask mandates,” trying to find a good in between with making Erin Perkins customers happy, but also making Perkins feel safe may be a challenging thing to do.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> This is a matter of debate, so leave it out. Instead, say what you like about the articles you read and why.

As of May thirteenth, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that non vaccinated individuals in New Hampshire did not have to wear a mask. As stated, Perkins was not ready for this change at the time. According to AARP this article claims that while you cannot necessarily force people to wear masks inside of a store, you can enforce that your employees do.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> This is useful information to include because it shows the relationship between masks and Covid. Leave it out unless you are briefly introducing the three states that already have mask mandates.

For the situation Perkins is in, the best compromise that could be made would be for her to enforce her employees to wear masks and to trust customers are vaccinated as there is not much else she can to do change the situation. This is because even if her customers are not taking the precautions, making the precautions for herself and her employees is better than not doing anything whatsoever.


> **Dr. H**:

> This is a pretty good compromise.

In the article “New mask guidelines are about politics and control,” Carlson makes his point very clear that the entirety of the mask mandate and vaccines are about politics and control. He says he was under the impression that if you got your covid vaccine, then you would not have to wear a mask. Following this he states “They got their shots, but the Biden administration has decided to continue to control,” proving his point clear.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> I’m not seeing this. Please explain more.

It is clear Carlson wants to feel as if he is being treated fair, that if he is being told one thing by the Biden Administration, he wants it to stay that way and not be changed. Considering this, overall, there is not much your average citizen can do besides attempt to make a compromise.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> I don’t see where the Biden administration tries to control things politically. What does Carlson claim?

The article claims a study in the New England Journal of Medicine stated and showed “COVID vaccines offer a high level of protection against even the new delta variant of the virus.” Picking up key words from this statement, it says that vaccines offer a high level of protection though a high level of protection does not mean it will completely protect a person who gets it.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> This is a pretty good response to the idea that political power is behind the mask mandate.

It is clear a good in between needs to be made with this situation. As stated, because the vaccine is not one hundred percent to protect you from the virus (but likely to) the best thing for an individual to do in this situation is to wear a mask, even if vaccinated. Overall. If you are vaccinated and a store says a mask is not mandatory, then that is up to the person to take the risk. Summarizing, even with a vaccine you are not completely safe, but with the vaccine and wearing a mask, you are as safe as you can get which seems to be the goal.

> This is a pretty good response to the idea that the purpose of the mandate is about the politics and control.

Lasty, for the article “As mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks,” mother of two, Charis Granger-Mbugua shared her fear of sending her children to school. At the time, the school Cobb located in Georgia where Charis sends her children, the mask mandate was lifted.


> **Dr. H**:

> This is not a valid end point because it is about the quality of education, not the absolute value of education. The value of education is in the learning.

Ultimately as already explained, Charis felt unformattable with sending her children to school without masks. Considering an online option was never stated in the article, she does not have much of a choice but to send her children to school.


> **Dr. H**:
>


> I’m not seeing this. Please explain what you think you see and why it is not working.

Referring to what I stated about the first article, while Perkins could not force customers to wear masks, she can force her employees to. The same goes for Charis, while she cannot do anything about the school dropping the enforcement of mask wearing, she can do her best and have her children to wear masks while at school. Overall, I believe this is the best solution because she would be doing what she can still while keeping her children protected.


> **Dr. H**:

> I think it might be easier for you to avoid opinion and argument if you don’t ask questions. That leads you away from analyzing the articles and into making your own argument.

Concluding, some people believe masks should be mandatory, some believe the complete opposite. Overall, there has been no set evidence that we should or should not be wearing masks. Vaccines are optional, but recommended. In the end, as of now, December of 2021, it is an individual's decision of they want to wear masks and or get the vaccine.

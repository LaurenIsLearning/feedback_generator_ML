            "One of the things you'll find about being in college is how important questions are, especially big questions that don't have easy answers. The questions you choose from for this project are probably all being discussed in one course or another, but they are also big issues being discussed outside of academia.\n",
            "For the project, choose one of the following to work with:\n",
            "What is the importance of critical race theory?\n",
            "What purpose does a mask mandate have?\n",
            "How much do we need to be concerned about climate change?\n",
            "What is behind the emphasis on STEM education?\n",
            "Your overall goal for the project is to be able to provide the best answer you can for the question. You'll do this in three parts:\n",
            "A Background that explains what the subject is and, briefly, what is being said about it. You and your readers need to know what it is and what it's about before you start discussing views on it. Key here is using objective sources for information.\n",
            "Your Analysis will bring in different views, different answers that people who think differently are giving for the question. You'll purposefully use biased sources for this part, to examine their arguments. You'll look for strong claims and for holes in the arguments as well as ways they appeal to logic, credibility, and emotion.\n",
            "Finally, the Response is where you will make your case for what you think the best answer is to the question by synthesizing what the different views present.\n",
            "I have purposefully worded the questions to allow for broad answers and not overly simple ones. Asking about the importance, the purpose, the concern, and the emphasis allows for answers on different sides and goes deeper into the issue (better than simply asking if something should or should not be taught or done).\n",
            "I encourage you to pick a question you know you can go into with an open mind. It will be tough for you if you don't.\n",
            "Part 1/Background\n",
            "The first segment of the project provides a foundation for answering the question by first explaining what the subject matter is behind the question. It has you further practicing being able to find good sources of information, explaining in a way that promotes a basic understanding of the subject, and being objective when you explain something controversial.\n",
            "For the question you are working with, provide information on the subject.\n",
            "Write 400-500 words that explain what the boldfaced term is and briefly introduce the debate regarding the question.\n",
            "You need to pull information from at least three sources that seem to provide an unbiased explanation of the bolded term. What does the term mean? Give a little history of it, perhaps. How far back does it go and when did it become mainstream recently? What are people saying about it? Be careful here not to go into the debate too much.\n",
            "Think about what adult readers probably already know. For example, you don‚Äôt need to explain what a mask is, but you need to explain what the mask mandate has referred to over the last year or so. Think about what will be a good foundation of knowledge for them going into the next part of the project where you look more closely at different views on the question itself.\n",
            "DO NOT use a dictionary definition. Nothing says junior high writer more than the words ‚ÄúAccording to Dictionary.com,‚Ä¶.‚Äù Anyone can look up a dictionary definition.\n",
            "You can use Wikipedia as one of your sources, but use only one encyclopedia kind of source, if that. And stay away from public post sites like About.com.\n",
            "Give just enough but not too much information or detail, and watch that you don‚Äôt use technical terms or jargon without explaining those.\n",
            "You may use no more than two quotes, and neither can be over 25 words long.\n",
            "The rest needs to be in your own words.\n",
            "You‚Äôll use MLA or APA citation format for this (your choice). Click either one to go to the Purdue OWL and use their resource for citation.\n",
            "This draft is worth 150 points. You get full points for composing a background that\n",
            "uses at least three sources,\n",
            "gives information on the subject,\n",
            "is at least 400 words,\n",
            "and is turned in on time.\n",
            "Is first person appropriate?\n",
            "Probably not. This background isn‚Äôt about what you think (yet). Be neutral and objective in how you explain, like you did for Project 1, so your readers know you will try to give them a full and fair treatment of the question throughout the project.\n",
            "How much of the background should be about the issues or debates involved?\n",
            "Try to keep that to at most a third of what you write. You‚Äôll get into the debates in the next part of the project, and you don‚Äôt want to be repetitive or risk not sounding objective.\n",
            "Why 400 words?\n",
            "There are books that could be written on these subjects, so 400 words forces you to select good information and be clear and concise. It‚Äôs enough to give readers a good foundation of knowledge.\n",
            "What will come before the background and what comes after it in the project?\n",
            "Your introduction will be the first thing in your finished project, where you will tell readers why the question is important and give it an interesting, engaging context (like a recent situation or development or statistics). After the background is the analysis of ways different sources with different views have answered the question, how they are trying to persuade their readers to think about the subject.\n",
            "Part 2/Analysis\n",
            "The second segment of the project has you researching the question by looking at answers that come from different (often political) perspectives, so that you are able to read for bias and consider different/opposing views at the same time. It also builds your critical thinking skills about what you read and how it is written.\n",
            "In 750-900 words, examine three articles that focus on addressing your question. Point out how the writing shows bias and appeals to emotion, credibility, and logic in the way it makes its points.\n",
            "Use the three sources provided on the next page for your question. Summarize briefly their answers, identifying the author and title of each in your writing as you use information from that source. Use your own wording, not quotes.\n",
            "Then show readers how bias comes out in the way the sources criticize or support their views. Rhetorically analyze their claims: Look for ways they use reasoning, appeals to credibility, and emotion to create an impression on their readers. You may use brief quotes, but only as examples to help explain where you see bias or rhetorical moves the article makes. The clear majority of what you write for the analysis should be your own words.\n",
            "Your purpose is to point out to your readers good points and weaker ones made by the different views as well as how the authors try to influence readers to see things their way. Keep your own opinion on the subject and question out of the analysis. Your opinion should be about how you see the authors arguing. Above all be fair.\n",
            "This draft is worth 250 points. You get full points for composing an analysis that\n",
            "uses the three sources,\n",
            "attempts to summarize and analyze those sources,\n",
            "is at least 750 words,\n",
            "and is turned in on time.\n",
            "How much should be summary?\n",
            "Summaries of the overall claim(s) each source makes should be brief, probably no more than 75 words each.\n",
            "How should you organize?\n",
            "It makes sense to analyze each source one at a time, but feel free to analyze them together where you see things that can easily be compared (for example, if they present a fact differently or say something that addresses what the other said). You can choose the order you discuss them as well.\n",
            "How much and what should be analyzed?\n",
            "That could be different for each source depending on what you notice going on in the writing. It‚Äôs a good idea to give the bulk of your analysis to the two opposing sources. Don‚Äôt try to pack everything you want to say about a source into one paragraph.\n",
            "Can you state your own opinion on the subject?\n",
            "No, not here. That will come out in the next (and last) part of the project. For the analysis, your opinion is focused only on how you see the sources making their arguments.\n",
            "For the critical race theory question use\n",
            "this New York Post source, this Raw Story source, and this PBS source.\n",
            "For the mask mandate question use\n",
            "this Nature source, this Fox News source, and this Atlanta Journal-Constitution source.\n",
            "For the climate change question use\n",
            "this Politico source, this Live Science source, and this Forbes Magazine source.\n",
            "For the STEM education question use\n",
            "this Hays source, this University of San Diego source, and this Albertnet source.\n",
            "Part 3/Response\n",
            "Now that you know more about the subject of your question and more about issues around it, you are in a good position to offer your own answer. Specifically, this final part of the project is where you synthesize points from the different views to make an argument for an answer that works toward a compromise.\n",
            "Compose your own answer to the question incorporating good points made from the different sides.\n",
            "Write 600-750 words responding to the question.\n",
            "Do not just pick one of the views you analyzed and repeat what it said. Synthesize (combine) points from the different views‚Äîthe two opposite ones and the more neutral one‚Äîalong with your own view to develop an answer you believe could act as a compromise between competing answers. Keep quoting to no more than 100 words total.\n",
            "Think of your readers as in the middle or leaning toward one view or another, not fully convinced of one of the arguments you analyzed. Try to influence how readers see the subject and question rather than convert them from a strongly held belief (trying to completely change someone‚Äôs view takes a lot more than 750 words).\n",

The questions you choose from for this project are probably all being discussed in one course or another, but they are also big issues being discussed outside of academia.\n",
            "For the project, choose one of the following to work with:\n",
            "What is the importance of critical race theory?\n",
            "What purpose does a mask mandate have?\n",

            "A Background that explains what the subject is and, briefly, what is being said about it. You and your readers need to know what it is and what it's about before you start discussing views on it. Key here is using objective sources for information.\n",
            "Your Analysis will bring in different views, different answers that people who think differently are giving for the question. You'll purposefully use biased sources for this part, to examine their arguments. You'll look for strong claims and for holes in the arguments as well as ways they appeal to logic, credibility, and emotion.\n",
            "Finally, the Response is where you will make your case for what you think the best answer is to the question by synthesizing what the different views present.\n",
            "I have purposefully worded the questions to allow for broad answers and not overly simple ones. Asking about the importance, the purpose, the concern, and the emphasis allows for answers on different sides and goes deeper into the issue (better than simply asking if something should or should not be taught or done).\n",
            "I encourage you to pick a question you know you can go into with an open mind. It will be tough for you if you don't.\n",
            "Part 1/Background\n",
            "The first segment of the project provides a foundation for answering the question by first explaining what the subject matter is behind the question. It has you further practicing being able to find good sources of information, explaining in a way that promotes a basic understanding of the subject, and being objective when you explain something controversial.\n",
            "For the question you are working with, provide information on the subject.\n",
            "Write 400-500 words that explain what the boldfaced term is and briefly introduce the debate regarding the question.\n",
            "You need to pull information from at least three sources that seem to provide an unbiased explanation of the bolded term. What does the term mean? Give a little history of it, perhaps. How far back does it go and when did it become mainstream recently? What are people saying about it? Be careful here not to go into the debate too much.\n",
            "Think about what adult readers probably already know. For example, you don‚Äôt need to explain what a mask is, but you need to explain what the mask mandate has referred to over the last year or so. Think about what will be a good foundation of knowledge for them going into the next part of the project where you look more closely at different views on the question itself.\n",

            "Why 400 words?\n",
            "There are books that could be written on these subjects, so 400 words forces you to select good information and be clear and concise. It‚Äôs enough to give readers a good foundation of knowledge.\n",
            "What will come before the background and what comes after it in the project?\n",
            "Your introduction will be the first thing in your finished project, where you will tell readers why the question is important and give it an interesting, engaging context (like a recent situation or development or statistics). After the background is the analysis of ways different sources with different views have answered the question, how they are trying to persuade their readers to think about the subject.\n",
            "Part 2/Analysis\n",
            "The second segment of the project has you researching the question by looking at answers that come from different (often political) perspectives, so that you are able to read for bias and consider different/opposing views at the same time. It also builds your critical thinking skills about what you read and how it is written.\n",
            "In 750-900 words, examine three articles that focus on addressing your question. Point out how the writing shows bias and appeals to emotion, credibility, and logic in the way it makes its points.\n",

            "Then show readers how bias comes out in the way the sources criticize or support their views. Rhetorically analyze their claims: Look for ways they use reasoning, appeals to credibility, and emotion to create an impression on their readers. You may use brief quotes, but only as examples to help explain where you see bias or rhetorical moves the article makes. The clear majority of what you write for the analysis should be your own words.\n",
            "Your purpose is to point out to your readers good points and weaker ones made by the different views as well as how the authors try to influence readers to see things their way. Keep your own opinion on the subject and question out of the analysis. Your opinion should be about how you see the authors arguing. Above all be fair.\n",

            "How much should be summary?\n",
            "Summaries of the overall claim(s) each source makes should be brief, probably no more than 75 words each.\n",
            "How should you organize?\n",
            "It makes sense to analyze each source one at a time, but feel free to analyze them together where you see things that can easily be compared (for example, if they present a fact differently or say something that addresses what the other said). You can choose the order you discuss them as well.\n",
            "How much and what should be analyzed?\n",
            "That could be different for each source depending on what you notice going on in the writing. It‚Äôs a good idea to give the bulk of your analysis to the two opposing sources. Don‚Äôt try to pack everything you want to say about a source into one paragraph.\n",
            "Can you state your own opinion on the subject?\n",
            "No, not here. That will come out in the next (and last) part of the project. For the analysis, your opinion is focused only on how you see the sources making their arguments.\n",
            "For the critical race theory question use\n",
            "this New York Post source, this Raw Story source, and this PBS source.\n",

            "Part 3/Response\n",
            "Now that you know more about the subject of your question and more about issues around it, you are in a good position to offer your own answer. Specifically, this final part of the project is where you synthesize points from the different views to make an argument for an answer that works toward a compromise.\n",
            "Compose your own answer to the question incorporating good points made from the different sides.\n",
            "Write 600-750 words responding to the question.\n",
            "Do not just pick one of the views you analyzed and repeat what it said. Synthesize (combine) points from the different views‚Äîthe two opposite ones and the more neutral one‚Äîalong with your own view to develop an answer you believe could act as a compromise between competing answers. Keep quoting to no more than 100 words total.\n",
            "Think of your readers as in the middle or leaning toward one view or another, not fully convinced of one of the arguments you analyzed. Try to influence how readers see the subject and question rather than convert them from a strongly held belief (trying to completely change someone‚Äôs view takes a lot more than 750 words).\n",
            "Do a little more research if you would like, but make sure you add the source(s) to your bibliography at the end. Your bibliography needs to include the three sources you used for background and the three used for analysis. NOTE: The bibliography does not count toward the 600-750 words.\n",
            "Use what you have learned about strong arguments and weaker ones. Think about what you noticed about making claims and supporting them from the evaluation segment of Project 1 and the analysis part of Project 2. Use that knowledge to explain your own points well, being cautious to avoid too much appeal to emotion and too little convincing support for your thoughts.\n",
            "This draft is worth 200 points. You get full points for composing an analysis that\n",
            "answers the question,\n",

            "Part of the challenge to this argument-making is compromising. Look around us and see how many hard lines have been drawn that divide people on serious issues. Let your response blur that line and bring different people together.\n",
            "Can you use more good points from one source than from another?\n",
            "Certainly. But be careful that you don‚Äôt dismiss the other view. Show you are being fair and trying to compose a compromising answer by acknowledging the stronger points made by the other arguments.\n",
            "Why the limit on quotes?\n",
            "This response is about what you think. Use quotes only to support your own thoughts in your own words.\n",
            "What style of writing is best?\n",
            "Use a serious and even-tempered tone and style. Don‚Äôt make it too sales-pitchy, but also don‚Äôt sound so academic that it doesn‚Äôt reach public readers.\n",
            "How should you do the bibliography?\n",
            "First, remember that the list of sources does not count toward the word count for the project. Use either MLA or APA (your choice) and put the sources in correct bibliographic citation format accordingly.\n",

            "      Is There A Middle-Ground For The Phenomenon of Climate Change?\n",
            "Climate change is a topic widely discussed in our society, yet the term and understanding of climate change isn‚Äôt as widely understood. As Melissa Denchak and Jeff Turrentine of NRDC states, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability‚Ä¶Record floods. Raging storms. Deadly heat.‚Äù Climate change has happened forever, yet many would argue that it is just now finding the light of society the past decade. The reason these ideas are finally being broadcast and understood by the public is because of the extreme global changes that have been seen. As the topic of climate change hit mass media there have been many people standing up and trying to make a change while others believe it‚Äôs too late to make much of a change. While there‚Äôs truth to both sides, how much do we need to be concerned about climate change? To truly understand climate change you first need to understand what it is exactly changing. NASA explains the evidence for rapid climate change is convincing, the claims of climate change include, global temperature rise, warming ocean, shrinking ice sheets, glacial retreat, decreased snow cover, sea level rise, and extreme events. NASA states, ‚ÄúDirect observations made on, and above Earth‚Äôs surface show the planet‚Äôs climate is significantly changing. Human activities are the primary driver to those changes.‚Äù These claims show and confirm climate change as an issue and that we as humans are the driving factor, yet do we need to be concerned if there aren‚Äôt any viable changes to be made that are truly realistic to today‚Äôs society? It is worth noting that climate change and global warming are used interchangeably, the recent change of the global average temperature is just one aspect of climate change. Understanding climate change is the first step towards any plan to negate or ignore the issue. Climate change has occurred for thousands of years yet very recently ramped up and even more recently became a topic of discussion and debate in the mass media. Understanding what climate change does and effects will greatly prepare an individual to make an educated decision on what impact they will have. Yet the question still reigns, how much should we be concerned?\n",
            "In understanding the topic of climate change, a reader needs to first look at the topic from all angles. The three articles that have clashing ideas that will be discussed are, ‚Äú‚ÄôGet scared‚Äô: World‚Äôs Scientists Say Disastrous Climate Change is Here‚Äù written by Zack Colman and Karl Mathiesen of politico.com, ‚ÄúAre We Really Running Out of Time to Stop Climate Change?‚Äù by Rafi Letzter of livescience.com, and ‚ÄúWhy Apocalyptic Claims About Climate Change Are Wrong‚Äù written by Michael Shellenberger of forbes.com. All these articles contain different types of persuasion or tactics to enable the reader to agree or see their view.\n",
            "To start off, Zack Colman and Karl Mathiesen attempt to threaten the reader that climate change is too late to fix. They claim in the title that disastrous weather is upon us and have a picture of a Greece wildfire as the cover picture. This already would bring the reader to a feeling of distraught. They carry on with statistics of top scientists explaining that those number mean that the consequences are inevitable. They then explain that the consequences would affect billions of people, later in that sentence they also state that it will lead to war. While there is no evidence for such a bold claim the reader is only left to feel scared that a war is now inevitable. As they go on to provide a picture of trees burned down due to a drought in California. They make no mention of the photo but continue to talk about the Paris Climate Agreement, making the reader now feel that the article starts to turn very political. As they go on for the last page of the article, they go over conversations and statements made by certain Senates and pledges made by others. The reader is left to feel that changes must need to happen within the government.\n",
            "The second article by Rafi Letzter questions whether we are really running out of time or not. As the cover picture shows a photo of a baby holding a sign during a climate change strike. This appeals to reader that they need to do the necessary things for the next generation. As Rafi attempts to comfort the reader and makes an understanding that climate change can‚Äôt just be stopped and that it‚Äôs already here yet there‚Äôs still hoped to help. The author goes on to explain the specific deadlines made by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The deadlines being that change is needed to happen by 2030 to truly have a chance to eliminate or better the world from climate change. This makes the reader feel as if the time is now and if anyone must do something it would be them and their generations calling. He continues to nail in the fact that this is not a case of ‚ÄúCan we stop this coming?‚Äù because it‚Äôs already here. He explains that the deadline of 2030 to hold the world to a warming increase by the end of the century is much more manageable short- and long-term problems. This makes the reader understand that the most crucial time for change would be now, the time of the next 9 years can affect the next 100 whether good or bad. He ends with explaining that the notion of 2030 can be misleading yet gets people into the streets. While that can make the article seem misleading in a whole now, it‚Äôs easy to understand that change is truly crucial with the facts he stated.\n",
            "The last article to be looked at is, Michael Shellenberger of Forbes.com. He begins the article stating that climate driven fires have made koalas functionally extinct and goes on to say that life on earth is dying. This makes the reader sad thinking that beautiful animals are going extinct and its due to climate change, making the reader almost angry because it‚Äôs just the start of climate change and other possible extinctions. He quotes a climate change activist saying that the world will end in 12 years of we don‚Äôt address climate change. Being such a bold claim it‚Äôs hard to truly believe such claim as a reader by the activist he is interviewing when that is said with no evidence or even any further talk of it. He then goes on to tell a story of the activists of climate change being ‚Äúbeat up‚Äù and claiming that a genocide like the Holocaust was happening again on a far greater scale and in plain sight, which is obviously untrue. Michael goes on to talk about his environmental organization and states the things they have done within the organization. As a reader it‚Äôs easy to understand and almost feel as ease while reading the article as he explains and disproves both sides bold claims. He then goes on to quote an interview with a BBC spokesperson and a ‚Äúvisibly uncomfortable XR (Extinction Rebellion) spokesperson‚Äù.  As the interview seems to shut down the XR spokesperson disproving their theories. He finishes the article the same way it was started by explaining the problems facing extinctions, as the reader gets on the same page and understands that there are other reasons change needs to occur, yet it isn‚Äôt as urgent as being portrayed by others.\n",
            "The three articles covered all attacked different angles of the argument of climate change, from believing we only have until 2030 to calling the 2030 deadline a borderline hoax and finally the last article explaining that we might not have to be as concerned or feel so strongly about the topic of climate change. To truly make a difference or change in anything, everyone must work together and attempt to make a difference or effort in making a change. To be able to do such a thing, the three conflicting side must come to a compromise.\n",
            "In my opinion, a compromise that makes sense for all sides involved or not, would be to be conscious toward the subject. Understand that there is a problem and issue and take conscious steps towards lessening the issue in the little ways. If everyone can come together and accomplish little things a change and agreement could be made. If everyone was able to simply remember to turn off the lights, use a reusable water bottle, cut food waste, and attempt to plant something. These little things don‚Äôt force upon pressure of the world ending or feel scared that we only have ‚Äú9 years‚Äù but it still lets us be conscious about the problem and make changes that could ultimately help. This decision also doesn‚Äôt totally ignore climate change as an issue completely, it gives everyone the opportunity to work together to make a change bigger than they would without the opposing side. If you are completely on the side of climate change not being an issue, doing some simple tasks would not only help the issue of climate change but can simply make improvements to the world and nature you live in. Being conscious to your surroundings is very important for you and next generations whether you believe in climate change or not. If you are on the side that the world is going to be messed up by 2030 if major changes don‚Äôt happen, you must understand the significant changes in society and everyone‚Äôs daily lives that would happen if such a large change were to happen before 2030. To make such a large change in such a short period of time would be near impossible, it would eliminate businesses, gas cars, and other daily activities that are unavoidable. As these changes simply aren‚Äôt realistic, being able to understand the other side and still work towards a goal you believe in seems very beneficial. Working together as one instead of pressuring either side seems to be the best option.\n",
            "I believe instead of making a reader feel threatened, scared, or even careless; isn‚Äôt the right emotion to portray for such a topic. Climate change is dealing with how humans treat the world we live on and the changes constantly happening to the earth. I believe instead of pressuring the reader, simply let both parties know and have an article encouraging unity. At the end of the day that is how change is going to happen. Whether you believe in climate change being a vital issue in the near future or not, everyone should have some care and feel some responsibility for making conscious decisions to help one another and to help the beautiful planet we all reside on. I believe this is the answer to the issue of climate change, understanding the parties and their worries while still making conscious decisions towards a neutral goal of preserving the earth. The answer needs no scientific evidence dating years and years back, simply needs common knowledge working together as one.\n",

            "Climate change is a topic widely discussed in our society, yet the term and understanding of climate change isn‚Äôt as widely understood. As Melissa Denchak and Jeff Turrentine of NRDC states, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability‚Ä¶Record floods. Raging storms. Deadly heat.‚Äù Climate change manifests itself and continues to break records in all categories of weather consistently. Climate change has happened forever, yet many would argue that it is just now finding the light of society the past decade. The human activity since the mid-20th century has rapidly increased the rate of change to our climate. The reason these ideas are finally being broadcast and understood by the public is because of the extreme global changes that have been seen. As the topic of climate change hit mass media there have been many people standing up and trying to make a change while others believe it‚Äôs too late to make much of a change. While there‚Äôs truth to both sides, how much do we need to be concerned about climate change? To truly understand climate change you first need to understand what it is exactly changing. NASA explains the evidence for rapid climate change is compelling, the claims of change include, global temperature rise, warming ocean, shrinking ice sheets, glacial retreat, decreased snow cover, sea level rise, and extreme events. NASA states, ‚ÄúDirect observations made on, and above Earth‚Äôs surface show the planet‚Äôs climate is significantly changing. Human activities are the primary driver to those changes.‚Äù These claims show and confirm climate change as an issue and that we as humans are the driving factor, yet do we need to be concerned if there aren‚Äôt any viable changes to be made that are truly realistic to today‚Äôs society? It is worth noting that climate change and global warming are used interchangeably, the recent change of the global average temperature is just one aspect of climate change. Understanding climate change is the first step towards any plan to negate or ignore the issue. Climate change has occurred for thousands of years yet very recently ramped up and even more recently became a topic of discussion and debate in the mass media. Understanding what climate change does and effects will greatly prepare an individual to make an educated decision on what impact they will have. Yet the question still reigns, how much should we be concerned?\n",

            "In understanding the topic of climate change, a reader needs to first look at the topic from all angles. The three articles that have clashing ideas that will be discussed are, ‚Äú‚ÄôGet scared‚Äô: World‚Äôs Scientists Say Disastrous Climate Change is Here‚Äù written by Zack Colman and Karl Mathiesen of politico.com, ‚ÄúAre We Really Running Out of Time to Stop Climate Change?‚Äù by Rafi Letzter of livescience.com, and ‚ÄúWhy Apocalyptic Claims About Climate Change Are Wrong‚Äù written by Michael Shellenberger of forbes.com. All these articles contain different types of persuasion or tactics to enable the reader to agree or see their view.\n",
            "To start off, Zack Colman and Karl Mathiesen attempt to threaten the reader that climate change is too late to fix. They claim in the title that disastrous weather is upon us and have a picture of a Greece wildfire as the cover picture. This already would bring the reader to a feeling of distraught. They carry on with statistics of top scientists explaining that those number mean that the consequences are inevitable. They then explain that the consequences would affect billions of people, later in that sentence they also state that it will lead to war. While there is no evidence for such a bold claim the reader is only left to feel scared that a war is now inevitable. As they go on to provide a picture of trees burned down due to a drought in California. They make no mention of the photo but continue to talk about the Paris Climate Agreement, making the reader now feel that the article starts to turn very political. As they go on for the last page of the article, they go over conversations and statements made by certain Senates and pledges made by others. The reader is left to feel that changes must need to happen within the government.\n",
            "The second article by Rafi Letzter questions whether we are really running out of time or not. As the cover picture shows a photo of a baby holding a sign during a climate change strike. This appeals to reader that they need to do the necessary things for the next generation. As Rafi attempts to comfort the reader and makes an understanding that climate change can‚Äôt just be stopped and that it‚Äôs already here yet there‚Äôs still hope to help. The author goes on to explain the specific deadlines made by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The deadlines being that change is needed to happen by 2030 to truly have a chance to eliminate or better the world from climate change. This makes the reader feel as if the time is now and if anyone must do something it would be them and their generations calling. He continues to nail in the fact that this is not a case of ‚ÄúCan we stop this coming?‚Äù because it‚Äôs already here. He explains that the deadline of 2030 to hold the world to a 1.5-C warming increase by the end of the century is much more manageable short- and long-term problems. This makes the reader understand that the most crucial time for change would be now, the time of the next 9 years can affect the next 100 whether good or bad. He ends with explaining that the notion of 2030 can be misleading yet gets people into the streets. While that can make the article seem misleading in a whole now, it‚Äôs easy to understand that change is truly crucial with the facts he stated.\n",

            "      What is the Mask Mandate all About?\n",
            "Covid-19 has been affecting the world for two years now, and masks have been mandated worldwide. Covid-19 may be a huge part of life now, but it has been around in other forms for centuries. The three more modern forms of the disease in the past two decades have been Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the more commonly known Novel Corona Virus (Covid-19) as stated by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. In 2019, Covid-19 originated from Wuhan, China within the animals sold at wet markets, which sell wild animals such as cobras, or boar. The virus then changed and was able to transfer from animals to humans. With the new virus‚Äô known ability to kill, protective measures have been very important in the past two years. With that, a mask mandate has been issued in several states in America. The mask mandate is a requirement in several states that forces citizens to wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention claims that, ‚Äúwhen you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one‚Äù. This statement has the thought of eliminating Covid-19 completely, though other people disagree. Some people claim that the mandate takes their freedom from them along with birth given rights. People even make protests to go against wearing the masks to defend their first amendment right of religion, expression and the right to protest. According to BBC, people have been kicked out of public establishments and refused service because they didn‚Äôt wear a mask inside the building. An example of this is shown when a Michigan pizza place told a customer that she had to wear a mask. She responded by kicking someone in the restaurant and escaped the police. The same kind of responses can be seen from people who refuse to get a Covid-19 vaccine. BBC also claims that the fight against masks can be linked with politics. At the time of the most recent presidential election, Trump supporters refused to wear a mask more often than Biden supports. This makes sense because Trump would often opt out of wearing masks at election events. The difference between opinions in politics has often caused riots to occur in public spaces. The argument on the mask mandate continues to unfold as the virus gets deadlier, but opinions have only gotten stronger in response to rules and regulations regarding masks.\n",
            "As mask guidelines evolve, some people are quick to judge, but others stand by these rules. An example of this belief is in the article, ‚ÄúOpinion: As mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks‚Äù, by Maureen Downey of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the article, she expresses concern about her two children going back to school with a pandemic in the mix. She then explains the delta variant of Covid-19 and the importance of the mask mandate put in place to protect people from it. She concludes the article with a request that schools make masks a requirement when in the building.\n",
            "When defending her claim, she cites her sources efficiently, while mixing evidence from her personal life into her ideas. Her sources are from news articles and current Covid-19 guidelines, making them fairly credible. News articles can be biased in certain cases, which can take away from the credibility of her support for someone who doesn‚Äôt understand where her sources are coming from. Fortunately for Downey, her sources come from reliable news sources that give statistics to defend their arguments. The evidence from Downey‚Äôs personal life provides a more emotional take on the topic. She achieves this by using flavorful language in her second paragraph. Downey states, ‚ÄúThe excitement of choosing the very best first day of school outfit or eagerly scanning class lists to see familiar names of friends to share a laugh and eat lunch with‚Äù. As well as, ‚ÄúIn its place, feelings of fear, worry, guilt, confusion, frustration, anger, and even impending doom loomed large and undeniable‚Äù. This shifts the mood from more of a lighthearted feel, to feelings of concern that reflect Downey‚Äôs opinions on the topic. This provides for a good transition to her sources, as well as a well put together article.\n",
            "Other people disagree strongly with the mask mandate that was put in place. This is shown in the article ‚ÄúNew Mask Guidelines are About Politics and Control‚Äù by Tucker Carlson on Fox News. Carlson begins his article by comparing strong regimes to strong people, and weak regimes to weak people to show his claim that the mask mandate is truly about the politics and control that he thinks president Biden possesses. The rest of the article follows this idea and how the mask guidelines have changed in correlation to it. Carlson‚Äôs comparison to Biden tries to tie the death of Nicolai Ceausescu to the mask mandate, and it doesn‚Äôt work. Carlson states, ‚ÄúAs his power evaporated, he tried even harder to exert it ‚Ä¶ we learned today that in the face of the waning pandemic, the Biden administration will dramatically increase¬†COVID¬†restrictions across the country‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt as effective as what he thinks it is. He doesn‚Äôt show research for that statement, or any statement for that matter to defend it. The only websites that are linked are search results on Fox News. This shows clear bias and the untrustworthiness that follows it. Carlson uses more emotional language than anything else. His article would strongly benefit from research that isn‚Äôt from Fox News that supports his claims with statistics. His article would be more credible, and less biased if he did.\n",
            "The article, ‚ÄúWhat the science says about lifting mask mandates‚Äù by Lynne Peeples is probably the best article to put in between the last two. It does fantastic work on not taking sides and coming up with unbiased arguments. The article begins with other people‚Äôs situations in regards to the mask mandate being lifted temporarily in some states. Peeples then uses statistics to prove that masks work. After that, she compares Covid-19 to the AIDS/HIV pandemic that occurred in the 1980‚Äôs. She concludes the article with an idea of what the mask mandate holds in the future. Peeple‚Äôs sources are reliable, and prove the effects that masks have in stopping the spread of disease. She only uses a few sources from her own website, but even those aren‚Äôt biased in any way. This article is purely just an overview of the mask mandate‚Äôs history in 2021, and other people‚Äôs opinions about it. Peeples states that, ‚Äújust two weeks after communicating that vaccinated people should continue to mask up indoors. Perkins wasn‚Äôt personally comfortable with unmasked people in her shop.‚Äù This shows how the mask mandate has affected peoples daily lives. Out of all of the articles stated, this article seems like the best way to get information about what the masks really do for people. No bias or opinion can affect what really happens scientifically, and this article does a great job expressing that.\n",
            "While the argument on the mask mandate is a difficult one, there are pros and cons to both, and a middle ground can be discovered through analysis of each view. The article ‚ÄúOpinion: As mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks‚Äù, by Maureen Downey, expresses interest in Masks for the sake of her children‚Äôs health. This proves to be a very logical conclusion to the mask mandate and a reasonable motive to promote masks to others, although she uses little to no statistics to defend herself. Her sources comprise of regulations already put into place, and almost entirely emotion-based language to show her concern to her children. Downey exclusively writes about educational policies, which supports her emotional speech, but not the statistical evidence that she needs. This leaves room for other opinions to make a rebuttal against this view.\n",
            "Another article called ‚ÄúNew mask guidelines are about politics and control‚Äù, by Tucker Carlson, believes that the mandate is about exactly what the title states. This seems like a bold and non-logical conclusion. It also doesn‚Äôt seem like a huge reason to be worried in my opinion. This article as well as the last use emotion to convey their thoughts. Carlson‚Äôs article uses it to state his opinion in our political system, rather than stating statistics to defend his claim. The sources he used are all from Fox News, which is the place that he works at. This leaves room to argue against the claim. If Carlson had used more statistics to prove that power and control is affecting the mask mandate, he would be more believable. The reason why the opposite viewpoints are arguing so much is probably explained by the fact that neither are defending themselves appropriately.\n",
            "Another take on the mask mandate is a more statistical and neutral one. The article, ‚ÄúWhat the Science Says About Lifting Mask Mandates‚Äù, by Lynne Peeples, focuses more on the scientific aspect of what masks do for the public. They claim that masks are an effective way of preventing Covid-19. And they analyze each viewpoint on the masks rather than picking a side and dismissing the other. Their conclusion is logical, and their motive for their opinion isn‚Äôt bizarre or strange. They have good reason to be concerned about the situation and use good sources to back it up. Peeples uses no emotional language to sway opinions and sticks to statistics to try to prove a point. All of the sources used in this article are credible and defend the claim greatly. This viewpoint has a lot of good things going for it, and it aligns with my viewpoint well.\n",
            "My view on this issue is that I don‚Äôt care if other individuals don‚Äôt wear masks. I will certainly wear one, but everyone else can do what they want. I agree with the fact that masks help reduce the spread of Covid-19, and I agree with the science behind it. I just don‚Äôt believe in the idea that masks are about power or control. If Carlson‚Äôs article had better sources, I would have been more inclined to listen to his opinion more. Dawson needs better sources too, but her view is still credible to me without it. The only solution that I can see working for the argument is that the government makes masks optional. Nothing will ever satisfy everyone in this scenario, but in my opinion, this is the closest anyone will get. To me, masks should be worn for self protection and other people who disagree should peacefully disagree. At this point, any solution beats the constant fighting.\n",

With that, a mask mandate has been issued in several states in America. The mask mandate is a requirement in several states that forces citizens to wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention claims that, ‚Äúwhen you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one‚Äù. This statement has the thought of eliminating Covid-19 completely, though other people disagree. Some people claim that the mandate takes their freedom from them along with birth given rights. People even make protests to go against wearing the masks to defend their first amendment right of religion, expression and the right to protest. According to BBC, people have been kicked out of public establishments and refused service because they didn‚Äôt wear a mask inside the building. An example of this is shown when a Michigan pizza place told a customer that she had to wear a mask. She responded by kicking someone in the restaurant and escaped the police. The same kind of responses can be seen from people who refuse to get a Covid-19 vaccine. BBC also claims that the fight against masks can be linked with politics. At the time of the most recent presidential election, Trump supporters refused to wear a mask more often than Biden supports. This makes sense because Trump would often opt out of wearing masks at election events. The fine line between opinions in politics has often caused riots to occur in public spaces. The argument on the mask mandate continues to unfold as the virus gets deadlier, but opinions have only gotten stronger in response to rules and regulations regarding masks.\n",

            "Covid-19 has been affecting the world for two years now, and masks have been mandated worldwide. Covid-19 may be a huge part of life now, but it has been around in other forms for centuries. The three more modern forms of the disease in the past two decades have been Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the more commonly known Novel Corona Virus (Covid-19) as stated by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. In 2019, Covid-19 originated from Wuhan, China within the animals sold at wet markets, which sell wild animals such as cobras, or boar.

            "While the argument on the mask mandate is a difficult one, there are pros and cons to both, and a middle ground can be discovered through analysis of each view. The article, ‚ÄúOpinion: As mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks‚Äù, by Maureen Downey, expresses interest in Masks for the sake of her children‚Äôs health. This proves to be a very logical conclusion to the mask mandate, and a reasonable motive to promote masks to others, although she uses little to no statistics to defend herself. Her sources comprise of regulations already put into place, and almost entirely emotion-based language to show her concern to her children. Downey exclusively writes about educational policies, which supports her emotional speech, but not the statistical evidence that she needs. This leaves room for other opinions to make a rebuttal against this view.\n",
            "Another article called ‚ÄúNew mask guidelines are about politics and control‚Äù, by Tucker Carlson, believes that the mandate is about exactly what the title states. This seems like a bold, and non-logical conclusion. It also doesn‚Äôt seem like a huge reason to be worried in my opinion. This article as well as the last, use emotion to convey their thoughts. Carlson‚Äôs article uses it to state his opinion in our political system, rather than stating statistics to defend his claim. The sources he used are all from Fox News, which is the place that he works at. This leaves room to argue against the claim. If Carlson had used more statistics to prove that power and control is affecting the mask mandate, he would be more believable. The reason why the opposite view points are arguing so much is probably explained by the fact that neither are defending themselves appropriately.\n",
            "Another take on the mask mandate is a more statistical and neutral one. The article, ‚ÄúWhat the Science Says About Lifting Mask Mandates‚Äù, by Lynne Peeples, focuses more on the scientific aspect of what masks do for the public. They claim that masks are an effective way of preventing Covid-19. And they analyze each viewpoint on the masks rather than picking a side and dismissing the other. Their conclusion is logical, and their motive for their opinion isn‚Äôt bizarre or strange. They have good reason to be concerned about the situation and use good sources to back it up. Peeples uses no emotional language to sway opinions, and sticks to statistics to try to prove a point. All of the sources used in this article are credible and defend the claim greatly. This viewpoint has a lot of good things going for it, and it aligns with my viewpoint well.\n",
            "My view on this issue is that I don‚Äôt care if other individuals don‚Äôt wear masks. I will certainly wear one, but everyone else can do what they want. I agree with the fact that masks help reduce the spread of Covid-19, and I agree with the science behind it. I just don‚Äôt believe in the idea that masks are about power or control. If Carlson‚Äôs article had better sources, I would have been more inclined to listen to his opinion more. Dawson needs better sources too, but her view is still credible to me without it. The only solution that I can see working for the argument is that the government makes masks optional. Nothing will ever satisfy everyone in this scenario, but in my opinion, this is the closest anyone will get. To me, masks should be worn for self protection and other people who disagree should peacefully disagree. At this point, any solution beats the constant fighting.\n",

            "      A novel approach to STEM education:  What if we‚Äôre all right?\n",
            "The idea of STEM education seems to be making more and more waves in the academic world lately.  As with any discussion regarding change to the status quo, strong opinions on both sides have emerged.  With such polarized positions, the task to create common ground could be a daunting one.  Perhaps, common ground doesn't need to be created at all.  What if the common ground has always been there?  Not only at the root of STEM but perhaps even as an agreed upon principle of all those who have chosen to be educators?\n",
            "What is STEM education?  According to Wyatt Dalton of Pearson Accelerated. Com says, it can simply be defined as a \"teaching philosophy \" that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math \"together into a single, cross-disciplinary program\".   The acronym STEM was reportedly first used in 2001 by the U.S. National Science Foundation in this source.   The article continues by stating that in the early 2000‚Äôs, reports came out stating that the students in the United States were not as proficient in the STEM subjects as those of other competing countries.  This fear has been a driving force in the development of educational programs across the United States in mathematics and science as well as engineering and technology for many decades.\n",
            "Some argue the roots of STEM education go back all the way to the middle of the cold war.  In this argument, a key moment in the space race, the beginnings of STEM can be traced to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. In his article, Alvin Powell suggests that the launch of Sputnik helped highlight the need for better education in the fields of science and mathematics in the United States.  This heightened understanding and the urgency created by our need to compete in the global race for technological advancement would go on to create the first of many math and science schools. These schools would later prove to be the foundation for the new philosophy of STEM education.\n",
            "So, what sets STEM apart from other forms of education? How is it different from traditional education?   Simply put it's the philosophy. In a tedx talk posted March 11th, 2014, nationally recognized educator, Robert Stephenson lays out his point of view on this new teaching philosophy.  In his presentation, he explained how the philosophy of STEM focuses on the innate desire for children to think \"outside the box\" to problem solve.  And that when you give them a task with minimal rules and no concrete model to follow, they will become engaged and persevere in search of a solution.  STEM fosters the child‚Äôs imagination and desire to learn.  This coupled with another aspect of STEM, community integration, where businesses engage with the schools and students encourages the students even more.\n",
            "STEM education is thought to be the solution for the U.S. to become more competitive in this global Market. STEM philosophy has shown signs of flexibility. There is much to be explored about STEM. Scholars have considered incorporating Arts into the STEM model \"STEAM\".  Some suggest adding Reading. \"STREAM\". This open-ended philosophy of integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and possibly other subjects is what‚Äôs making STEM sought out as potentially the next teaching philosophy of the 21st century. Perhaps STEM will be the future of education not only in the U.S. but worldwide.\n",
            "STEM can mean different things to different people depending on one's perspective. The view of STEM can range from a hardline stance of being the only chance for our country's economic survival to the opposite end of the spectrum being unnaturally and unnecessarily forced upon a society. In my analysis of three articles written on STEM you will begin to see some examples of individual perspective being displayed through the writings from three different authors.\n",
            "In the first article entitled, ‚ÄúWhy we need more young people in STEM- and how we can do it\", the author argues that the economy of STEM is advancing faster than there are people perusing STEM careers. In the beginning of the article, he paints a grim view of our future, using numerous emotional arguments to drive his point. He attempts to create fear by saying that the statistics are \"incredibly worrying\".  He uses statements of urgency, saying as early as 2024 America stands to see \"a deficit of 1.1 million STEM jobs\". He then attempts to create a sense of ownership and team by suggesting that we all have a \"Duty\" to not only encourage but to inspire the next generation to pursue STEM careers. He ends his opening argument with a statement of impending doom. He suggests that if we fail at our task to encourage and inspire that \"all the progress made in innovation could falter'.\n",
            "At this point the author seems to transition from a position of fear to one of encouragement and inclusiveness explaining how different sectors of the community all can participate in the task of encouraging more STEM involvement.  Whether it's parents, friends, schools, businesses, or government, we all need to come together and play our part. The author finalizes his argument with another appeal to fear and urgency by restating his opinion that if we don't succeed in producing a larger STEM workforce, our progress will \"splutter and stall\".\n",
            "The second article \"why STEAM is so important to 21st century education\" by Joseph Latham PhD, continues support for the need of STEM education. He also introduces one of the more modern augmentations of STEM, STEAM.   Here he suggests the importance of incorporating the arts to STEM. He argues that STEAM isn't just adding a subject to STEM. STEAM adds a dynamic focus on creating a more diverse student with more creativity and better communication skills than those studying under the STEM system.\n",
            "Throughout this article, the author doesn't make strong emotional appeals as did the author of the \"Hays\" article, rather he stays on a more intellectual theme.  He uses facts and figures as the bases of his arguments and once explained moves on.  He doesn't take a strong personal stance on the STEAM approach vs STEM. This becomes apparent as the article progresses and the reader sees the author using STEM and STEAM as relatively two interchangeable disciplines. Another major difference between this article and the \"Hays\" article is the willingness of the author to recognize that education In STEM or STEAM can be beneficial to students choosing non-STEM/STEAM career paths.\n",
            "The third article entitled \"stop pushing STEM\" by Dana Albert makes an extreme departure from both the more pro STEM ‚ÄúHays\" article and even the more open and inclusive \"USD\" article. In this article Dana Albert expresses his strong opinion that the focus on STEM education is misplaced.\n",
            "He starts off with a very strong emotionally charged argument, pointing out what he sees as hypocrisy from current elected officials.  He questions if they think of themselves as \"special\". He asks if they believe they can have careers outside of STEM while deeming the next generation \"doomed\" if they don't go into STEM jobs. After that heated introduction the author transitions into a more fact driven format. He lays out piece by piece his argument why STEM education is no more needed now than it has been in the past and in the projected future.  He uses charts and logic-based arguments to show that differences in income between STEM and non-STEM jobs are not as large as others have argued.  He then pivots away from his more factual approach to one more appeal to the readers emotional side by suggesting that by pushing all children into STEM doesn't consider the individual child's personality and interests.  He equates forcing a child who doesn't have the aptitude, personality, or desire for STEM to be unnatural like forcing a cat to accept a leash.\n",
            "Each of these three authors used emotional argumentation to one degree or another to direct their readers. In doing so they helped demonstrate that each person has a unique understanding of the world around them.  It is this uniqueness that creates such diverse opinions on a subject.  This one in particular: STEM education.\n",
            "So where do we go from here?  If STEM can mean so many different things to so many people, how can we possibly find common ground?  And just exactly how does one incorporate the myriad of opinions from such a diverse pool?   I believe that perhaps the solution is already in each person‚Äôs understanding. The authors just never mention it.  It's there in the emotional hardline response of the Hays article, where Alistair Cox's fearfully argues that the world of STEM is moving faster than we are creating STEM workers.  You can also find it in the less emotional charged writings of Joseph Latham PhD. in the USD article where he argues in a more even tone but strongly advocates to significantly change STEM to a more arts centered program STEAM.  Lastly, I argue that even in the completely opposite argument of Dana Albert where he suggests that STEM is not needed to the degree some are pushing, the solution does reside as well.\n",
            "If you look at all three of these arguments, one common theme arises from each.  This being the authors collective desire to create the best education for the next generation.  Whether it's to fill an ominous gap in the STEM workforce, to create better communicators across all the STEM disciplines, or to simply encourage each child to pursue their own individual educational path, they all center on the child's education.\n",
            "In the definition of STEM taken from the beginning of this paper, Wyatt Dalton of Pearson accelerated.com states that STEM is ‚ÄúA teaching philosophy \" that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math \"together into a single, cross-disciplinary program\".  If you couple this definition with our three author‚Äôs common goal, you can begin to see just how intertwined these authors are.  They all share the actual Philosophy of STEM. Yes, in their own ways, but it's there in all three arguments.  Even Dana Albert express STEM philosophy while actively making an argument against the overuse of STEM education when he focuses on how every student possesses different personalities, interests, and aptitudes.  It is that very understanding of the individual that helps form this foundation of STEM.\n",
            "In the Tedx talk presentation mentioned earlier in this paper posted March 11th, 2014, Robert Stephenson does an exemplary job at expanding on how this philosophy, when applied in the classroom, can help to foster a child's creativity and desire to learn and problem solve.  This way of teaching could assist a child in discovering an interest in the hard Sciences and other aspects of STEM.  Even if STEM isn't ultimately that child's educational outcome, the experience in STEM education could have far reaching positive effects in creating a more rounded and potentially qualified member of the work force, regardless of which employment path that child takes.  In his article, Dana Albert mentions he studied STEM curriculum after entering the workforce and has worked in the tech world his whole career.   He says this was a direct result of taking an aptitude test at his first job.  This makes me wonder.   If he had an aptitude all along for technology, and I would argue a personality as well, then perhaps had he been educated in STEM and introduced to computers under the STEM philosophy, he would have then, early on, discovered an interest as well.  This in no way negates his argument. It simply underlines how using STEM philosophies early on in a child‚Äôs education could help direct a child to discover a potential educational interest.\n",
            "I believe if we all embrace this philosophy and use the open-ended instructional methods of STEM, there would be common ground found and no longer a reason to argue against, but perhaps a reason to argue for adding the arts to make STEAM or reading to make STREAM, or even another acronym not yet imagined.  It is this philosophy of integrating subjects, encouraging children to think outside the box, and focusing more on, as Dana Albert mentions, a child's aptitude, personalities, and interests, that could be the glue that binds us all together. As we have surmised, it could even spark a student‚Äôs interest in the STEM core subjects; an interest the student otherwise may never have discovered.\n",
            "I further believe that it's this philosophy that not only binds these authors together but will bind the future of education and STEM, not only with us in the United States, but to a greater extent, the Global educational community. How amazing is it, that within such widely varying points of view there can exist such a strongly agreed upon principle?\n",

            "In the first article, the (Hays article) written by Alistair Cox, entitled, ‚ÄúWhy we need more young people in STEM- and how we can do it\", the author argues that the economy of STEM is advancing faster than there are people perusing STEM careers. In the beginning of the article, he paints a grim view of our future, using numerous emotional arguments to drive his point.

Whether it's parents, friends, schools, businesses, or government, we all need to come together and play our part. The author finalizes his argument with another appeal to fear and urgency by restating his opinion that if we don't succeed in producing a larger STEM workforce, our progress will \"splutter and stall\".\n",
            "The second article \"why STEAM is so important to 21st century education\" by Joseph Latham PhD (referred to as the \"USD\" article), continues support for the need of STEM education. He also introduces one of the more modern augmentations of STEM, STEAM.   Here he suggests the importance of incorporating the arts to STEM. He argues that STEAM isn't just adding a subject to STEM. STEAM adds a dynamic focus on creating a more diverse student with more creativity and better communication skills than those studying under the STEM system.\n",

He uses facts and figures as the bases of his arguments and once explained moves on.  He doesn't take a strong personal stance on the STEAM approach vs STEM. This becomes apparent as the article progresses and the reader sees the author using STEM and STEAM as relatively two interchangeable disciplines. Another major difference between this article and the \"Hays\" article is the willingness of the author to recognize that education In STEM or STEAM can be beneficial to students choosing non-STEM/STEAM career paths.\n",
            "The third article entitled \"stop pushing STEM\" by Dana Albert makes an extreme departure from both the more pro STEM ‚ÄúHays\" article and even the more open and inclusive \"USD\" article.

He questions if they think of themselves as \"special\". He asks if they believe they can have careers outside of STEM while deeming the next generation \"doomed\" if they don't go into STEM jobs. After that heated introduction the author transitions into a more fact driven format. He lays out piece by piece his argument why STEM education is no more needed now than it has been in the past and in the projected future.  He uses charts and logic-based arguments to show that differences in income between STEM and non-STEM jobs are not as large as others have argued.\n",
            "As the article continues the author begins to focus on how pushing all children into STEM doesn't consider the individual child's personality and interests.

            "      To Mask Mandate or Not? That is The Real Question\n",
            "Why are so many people opposed to masking up? Is the mask mandate political? How does the mask mandate change a person view of the pandemic?\n",
            "What is a mask mandate? A mask mandate is a government ruling to reduce the spread of any viral disease that can spread via air currents. The COVID-19 Delta variant has made transferring the virus quite easy to pass from one person to another. Since this new variant transformed from the last one, a mask mandate was put into place to reduce the spread. ‚ÄúIn April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19.‚Äù (Wikipedia)\n",
            "Why did the CDC change the mask mandate from not wearing masks for the general public in early 2020 to recommending on April 3,2020 that the general public wear cloth coverings? In early 2020, the WHO gave recommendations that people that were suspected of infection and respiratory symptoms, healthcare workers, caregivers of the sick and those that shared living space should be the ones to wear a medical mask. Then in June 2020, the CDC revised the mask mandate to recommend the general public wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing was not possible. Covid-19 is spread by close contact with people. The CDC said wearing of masks serve two purposes; reducing the spread of COVID-19 from being exhaled into the surrounding area. If one chooses to wear a mask it reduces the chances at getting the COVID-19 virus, this causing the virus to reduce infecting others.\n",
            "The CDC required the wearing of a mask back on April 3, 2020. The requirement of a mask has shown a wide variety of different masks being created or bought. Some masks that can be used in the mask mandate are cloth masks, different surgical variants, bandanas, respirators, and face shields. The only requirements for a face mask are that it needs to have at least 3 layers of liner, no loose fabrics, no slits, and it needs to cover both nose and mouth. Children under the age of 2 should not wear masks, according to the CDC. ‚ÄúAs of Sept. 13,2021, there are 42 U.S. states and territories that do not have state/territories mask mandates‚Äù (U.S. News article)\n",
            "Several schools and districts returned to remote learning in IN, they implemented a mask mandate for them to continue education for children. They attempted to start of the year with mask-optional which was in response to the demands of parents. Mask mandates are required in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status in most states in areas where Covid-19 is surging. the CDC‚Äôs latest guidance was established in 12 U.S. states/territories. Only California, Connecticut, and New York have mask mandates for the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated should wear a mask to protect themselves and others in outdoor settings per the CDC. Fully vaccinated should wear a mask in a packed outdoor setting and activities that involve any close contact with people that are not fully vaccinated.\n",
            "According to Tucker Carlson mandating millions of children to wear masks is lunacy, because the wearing of masks has a serious risk to children than the COVID-19 virus does. He does not agree with the wearing of masks by vaccinated adults either. People were promised that if they took the vaccine, they would be regular again. Carlson stated that a rational person might think they were lied too. Does the vaccination not work as intended?\n",
            "Tucker Carlson believes that the mask mandate is being used for political strategy. He believes that the Biden administration has used Covid to ride to victory last November. Carlson stated that the US is clever because they used the Chinese military to create the virus in the first place. When people read this article, it gives bias onto another country because Carlson believes that the COVID-19 virus was created by another government for strategic purpose. This observation about reading the article induces fear onto the readers, putting them into a mindset that makes them completely agree with what is being said to keep them safe from harm.\n",
            "All the information given by this opinion article is pumped full of more Fox News articles. From what is shown on the page there is no outside sources being credited. One would start thinking that the ads from the articles are making the funding to keep writing these opinion pieces. The ads on the page have nothing to do with what the article is stating, they only promote more Fox News.\n",
            "In Tucker Carlson‚Äôs article ads, it shows ads towards celebrities and the new cops show they are promoting. The links have nothing to contribute to Carlson‚Äôs article, but in the article ‚ÄúAs a mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks.‚Äù by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, all the links relate to her opinion article. The 2021-22 school year for Georgia, Cobb has a policy that encourages masks. But, it is not requiring them for in-person learning. To keep children safe when doing in-person learning it should be a priority to implement masking to everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status.\n",
            "There is no evidence that masking up is detrimental to her well-being and long-term health, but without it, her children could become sick with Covid-19 and infect someone. Charis Granger-Mbugua wrote this article because she fears for the safety of her children not wearing a mask to school. The article talks about children bringing home COVID-19 virus to immune compromised individuals. She fears for the safety of everyone involved with school children.\n",
            "The article has some good creditable sources like the New York Times, ABC News, and the Georgia Department of Public Health. One of the links included in the article leads to a letter to the Georgia School Superintendents. Charis Granger-Mbugua shows bias because as a mother of two children it states in the article that children of color are disproportionately impacted by severe illness that is caused by the COVID-19 virus. Parents can relate to her article because if they have children, they would want them well.\n",
            "According to the article ‚Äúwhat science says about lifting mask mandates‚Äù by Lynne Peeples. It is about a debate over the effectiveness of masks, to mask up or not, goes on. Both state and federal moves to lift mask mandates for the fully vaccinated happened a little too fast according to Anne Hoen, an epidemiologist at Dartmouth College. In March of this year a survey of more than 350,000 people said they were wearing a mask.\n",
            "Lynn Peeples used a mural that promoted mask wearing while honoring health workers in Mexico City, while at the same time there is a man working on plants that is masked up. Later, a No Face Mask, No Entry picture is used for a shop in Wales, UK. Using photos, Peeples is showing that many individuals are not ok with changing things right away. Peeples goes on to say that effective messaging is vital to getting individuals to wear a mask.\n",
            "Peeple‚Äôs article information comes from The Lancet, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc. Which everything is written or published by medical scholars. Even the related articles talk about COVID, masks, hotspots, and what the data is saying. The tone that comes from this article is a serious mood. It shows strictness between how each community is taking the COVID-19 virus. Each community will take different precautions depending on how they see it.\n",
            "For Lynn Peeples she tries to promote strong points of safety towards the community in her article. By showing how the community is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. By having a sign posted to a mural painted influences a person's attitude towards a subject. For the mask mandate in the community of Lynn Peeples article it states that a business owner knows that they have customers with compromised immune systems. With a mask mandate in place, it reduce the chances of people with compromised immune systems from catching COVID-19.\n",
            "Which leads me to Tucker Carlson, he talks about the political stance he takes against why wearing a mask is so wrong. We have not needed to wear one before the pandemic, why would we now. This observation of this stance changes a person mind to think like Tucker Carlson. It is true that we did not need to wear a mask before the pandemic but the world changes daily.\n",
            "From what I have read through Carlsons article he states the Biden administration is only for political gain, China created the COVID-19 virus, and masking children is detrimental to their health. These are weak points about the mask mandate because there has been no study shown that masking children is detrimental to their health. Rather the virus was created in China or not, it is still here. The Biden administration has no political gain, why would the government want a pandemic for elections?\n",
            "During the Trump administration the wearing of mask was not required at the time, but this was because of the shortage of masks, this was stated in the Wikipedia for politics. One could see this as a political gain because the most diehard of fans would follow through with what the Trump administration states. By not wearing a mask the spread of COVID-19 would infect more causing the election to be mailed out to the households.\n",
            "In the article by Maureen Downey, it states that the 2021-22 school year for Georgia, Cobb has a policy that encourages masks, but is not requiring them for in-person learning. A good point about the mask mandate is the debate around masking, it is a choice and is not a terrible thing. Many send their children to school knowing they might get sick, or even bring the virus home to a fragile family member.\n",
            "District leaders and elected officials could just choose to do the right thing, by just implementing the wearing of a face mask. Charis Granger-Mbugua also makes a good strong point because she says that it is hard for a child to wear a mask all day when she sees her peers are not. In relation to this, Tucker Carlson states that it is detrimental for a child to wear a mask all day long.\n",
            "Not everyone likes to wear a face mask. They are itchy, leaves marks on our face, makes our faces red, and they start to stick after a while after use. The CDC has made it where you don‚Äôt have to wear a good face mask just a decent one. Different face masks that you can wear are from a bandana to a face shield if you so choose. On the CDC website each mask has a requirement that needs to be followed so it can be regulated. You don‚Äôt want to be the person outside sucking SpaghettiOs through your gas mask hose thinking it's safe for air intake.\n",
            "This is my own point of view on what the purpose of a mask mandate is. I am 100 percent behind the mask mandate because if a mask can keep me safe as well as my family safe from COVID-19 I am all for it. You do not need to know about everything that is put into a vaccine. If the government says its safe, its safe. the government has spent millions of dollars, literally hundreds of scientists and virologist have worked on this vaccine.\n",

            "      What is a mask mandate? What mask qualify for a mask mandate? When did the Covid-19 mask mandate start? A mask mandate is a government ruling to keeping the public safe from harm. The government sets rules to keep order and neatness. If this was not the case the world would be in complete anarchy. Getting back to the covid mask mandate the CDC required the wearing of a mask back on April 3, 2020. The mask mandate has recently taken a wide notice from ‚Äúmany governors ‚Äì including some who have changed their earlier stances on masks as COVID-19 cases have surged in their states ‚Äì strongly encourage wearing face masks‚Äù (Hubbard, K., These States Have COVID-19 Mask Mandates.) The mask mandate is not only affecting the general public, but it is also affecting the education of children. Children under the age of 2 should not wear masks, according to the CDC. As of Sept. 13,2021 there are 42 U.S. states and territories that do not have state/territories mask mandates per the U.S. News article.  Governors encourage people to wear masks and be respectful and courteous of others. Back before the mask mandate kids and the parents did not have to worry about getting a deadly disease. But, because of recent events with the COVID-19 Delta outbreak schools are being shut down. Because they are unable to accommodate for the current stress of the situation. These events leading to schools to put a mask mandate for them to continue education for kids. Schools are required to follow new policies when put into place but also ‚ÄúSchools with mask mandates can continue to follow more strict quarantine policies, if they would like.‚Äù (Herron, A., Indiana schools can Stop QUARANTINES, but only if they have MASK mandate in place.) Several schools and distracts returned to remote learning in IN. They attempted the start of the year with mask-optional which was in response to the demands of parents per the IndyStar article.  Mask mandates are required in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status in most states in areas where Covid-19 is surging, per the CDC‚Äôs latest guidance was established in 12 U.S. states/territories.

            "The Biden administration still tells people where to go, who they can talk to, and what they can wear. Because public health leaders make the ruling based on data to protect their loved ones and themselves from the virus, this is just an extra step because the virus is so transmissible. Tucker Carlson said it is more of a you wear a mask because the government said so. They issue the mandate to wear a mask without explaining it, you then obey it. Our government calls you a murderer if you don‚Äôt obey it, that is just how the government works. The White House is a decaying system, the people who make the decisions are being discredited too.\n",

To keep children safe when doing in-person learning it should be a priority to implement masking to everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status.\n",
            "Charis Granger-Mbugua has shared her fear about sending her two young children to school knowing they do not have a mask mandate.  Masking would protect her children against Covid-19. Her feelings of a new school year beginning with joyful anticipation were replaced by fear, guilt, anger, worry at the unknown safety and health of her children. Charis tries to teach her children to make ‚Äúgood choices.‚Äù That the debate around masking is choice, and for all intents and purposes, is not a bad thing. Many send their children to school knowing they might get sick, or even bring the virus home to a fragile family member. Many cannot afford adequate health care for their families let alone themselves. She wants you to listen to the experts, to sacrifice your comfort and preferences now and make the choice to mask up. Think about the children that are ineligible to get the vaccination.\n",
            "Maybe just maybe district leaders and elected officials could just choice to do the right thing, making it a priority to choose the safety and health of families and students by masking up. That it is hard for a child to wear a mask all day when she sees her peers are not. There is no evidence that masking up is detriment to her well-being and long-term health, but without it, she could become sick with Covid-19 and infect someone. As a mother, responsible adult, uncomfortable decisions can be made to protect our children and others.\n",
            "The debate over the effectiveness of masks, rather to mask up or not, goes on. Both state and federal moves to lift mask mandates for the fully vaccinated happened a little too fast according to Anne Hoen, an epidemiologist at Dartmouth College. The article ‚ÄúWhat the science says about lifting mask mandates‚Äù by Lynn Peeples was out of step for many other countries, that the USA had weakened its policies. Confusion and a mess of data that needed interpreted by public-health officials and politicians has been a problem throughout the entire pandemic. They are making it up as they have gone along, public-health scientists and officials are struggling to get unvaccinated people to wear masks, even though there is clear evidence that‚Äôs masks cut down on Covid-19 deaths. It is said changes need to be made carefully, relaxing restrictions to give people hope and motivation to get the vaccine.\n",
            "April 6,2020, Jena, Germany was the first community in the world to require people to wear masks in public. Dropping new cases by 75% during the 20 days after the ruling was brought out to the city.  They used messaging and role models to get the public ready. Large-scale spread of disease through mask mandates was adverted in China and other Asian nations. Early wearing of face masks in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths in the United States by more that 10 percentage points in late April 2020. Deaths could have been reduced by as much as 47% across the country by May 2020.\n",
            "In March of this year a survey of more than 350,000 people said they were wearing a mask, not because of government mandates. People were wearing a mask because masks protect both the wearer and the people around them. Mandates do have effect but so does community buy-in.\n",

            "      What is a mask mandate? A mask mandate is a government ruling to reduce the spread of any viral disease that can spread via air currents. The COVID-19 Delta variant has made transferring the virus quite easy to pass from one person to another. Since this new variant transformed from the last one, a mask mandate was put into place to reduce the spread. ‚ÄúIn April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19.‚Äù (Wikipedia)\n",
            "Why did the CDC change the mask mandate from not wearing masks for the general public in early 2020 to recommending on April 3,2020 that the general public wear cloth coverings? In early 2020, the WHO gave recommendations that people that were suspected of infection and respiratory symptoms, healthcare workers, caregivers of the sick and those that shared living space should be the ones to wear a medical mask. Then in June 2020, revised the mask mandate to recommend the general public wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing was not possible. Covid-19 is spread by close contact with people. The CDC said wearing of masks serve two purposes, reducing the spread of COVID-19 from being exhaled into the surrounding area. If one chooses to wear a mask it reduces the chances at getting the COVID-19 virus, this causing the virus to reduce infecting others.\n",
            "The CDC required the wearing of a mask back on April 3, 2020. The requirement of a mask has shown a wide variety of different mask being created or bought. Some mask that can be used in the mask mandate are cloth masks, different surgical variants, bandanas, respirators, and face shields. The only requirements for a face mask are that it needs to have at least 3 layers of liner, no loose fabrics, no slits, and it needs to cover both nose and mouth. Children under the age of 2 should not wear masks, according to the CDC. ‚ÄúAs of Sept. 13,2021, there are 42 U.S. states and territories that do not have state/territories mask mandates‚Äù (U.S. News article)\n",
            "Several schools and distracts returned to remote learning in IN, they implemented a mask mandate for them to continue the education for children. They attempted to start of the year with mask-optional which was in response to the demands of parents per the IndyStar article. Mask mandates are required in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status in most states in areas where Covid-19 is surging, per the CDC‚Äôs latest guidance was established in 12 U.S. states/territories. Only California, Connecticut, and New York have mask mandates for the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated should wear a mask to protect themselves and others in outdoor settings per the CDC. Fully vaccinated should wear a mask in a packed outdoor setting, and activities that involve any close contact with people that are not fully vaccinated.\n",
            "According to Tucker Carlson mandating millions of children to wear masks is lunacy, because the wearing of masks has a serious risk to children than the COVID-19 virus does. He does not agree with the wearing of masks by vaccinated adults either. People were promised that if they took the vaccine, they would be regular again. Carlson stated that a rational person might think they were lied too, does the vaccination not work as intended?\n",
            "Tucker Carlson believes that the mask mandate is being used for political strategy. He believes that the Biden administration has used Covid to ride to victory last November. Carlson stated that the US is clever because they used the Chinese military to create the virus in the first place. When people read this article, it gives bias onto another country because Carlson believes that the COVID-19 virus was created by another government for strategic purpose. This observation about reading the article induces fear onto the readers, putting them into a mindset that makes them completely agree with what is being said to keep them safe from harm.\n",
            "All the information given by this opinion article is pumped full of more Fox News articles. From what is shown on the page there is no outside sources being credited. One would start thinking that the ads from the articles are making the funding to keep writing these opinion pieces. The ads on the page have nothing to do with what the article is stating, they only promote more Fox News.\n",
            "In Tucker Carlson‚Äôs article ads, it shows ads towards celebrities and the new cops show they are promoting. The links have nothing to contribute to Carlsons article, but in the article ‚ÄúAs a mother of young children, I beg Cobb to mandate masks.‚Äù by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, all the links relate to her opinion article. The 2021-22 school year for Georgia, Cobb has a policy that encourages masks, but is not requiring them for in-person learning. To keep children safe when doing in-person learning it should be a priority to implement masking to everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status.\n",
            "There is no evidence that masking up is detriment to her well-being and long-term health, but without it, her children could become sick with Covid-19 and infect someone. Charis Granger-Mbugua wrote this article because she fears for the safety of her children not wearing a mask to school. The article talks About children bringing home COVID-19 virus to immune compromised induvial, she fears for the safety of everyone involved with school children.\n",
            "The article has some good creditable sources like the New York Times, ABC News, and the Georga Department of Public Health. One of the links included in the article leads to a letter to the Georgia School Superintendents. She shows bias because, as a mother of two children it states in the article that children of color are disproportionately impacted by severe illness that is caused by the COVID-19 virus. Many cannot afford adequate health care for their families let alone themselves. Parents can relate to her article because if they have children, they would want them well.\n",
            "According to the article ‚Äúwhat science says about lifting mask mandates‚Äù by Lynne Peeples is about a debate over the effectiveness of masks, to mask up or not, goes on. Both state and federal moves to lift mask mandates for the fully vaccinated happened a little too fast according to Anne Hoen, an epidemiologist at Dartmouth College. In March of this year a survey of more than 350,000 people said they were wearing a mask.\n",
            "Lynn Peeples used a mural that promoted mask wearing while honoring health workers in Mexico City, while at the same time there is a man working on plants that is masked up. Later, a No Face Mask, No Entry picture is used for a shop in Wales, UK. Using photos, Peeples is showing that many individuals are not ok with changing things right away. Peeples goes on to say that effective messaging is vital to getting individuals to wear a mask.\n",
            "Peeples article information comes from The Lancet, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc. which everything is written or published by medical scholars. Even the related articles talk about COVID, masks, hotspots, and what the data is saying. The tone that comes from this article is a serious mood. It shows strictness between how each community is taking the COVID-19 virus. Each community will take different precautions depending on how they see it.\n",
            "Reading through Lynn Peeples article, her entire article promotes why there is a mask mandate. When Lynn Peeples uses condoms for HIV/AID, it is the same premise for why there should be a mask mandate for the COVID-19 virus. Does making a mask personalized determine whether you wear one or not? In Peeples article it talks about when people create their own mask, they are more likely to accept the wearing of it.\n",
            "Not everyone likes to wear a face mask. They are itchy, leaves marks on our face, makes our faces red, and they start to stick after a while after use. The CDC has made it where you don‚Äôt have to wear a good face mask just a decent one. Different face mask that you can wear are from a bandana to a face shield if you so choose. Now just because the CDC regulated a wide variety of different masks does not mean you can go outside without a mask. On the CDC website each mask has a requirement that needs to be followed so it can be regulated. you don‚Äôt want to be the person outside sucking SpaghettiOs through your gas mask hose thinking it's safe for air intake.\n",
            "Which leads me to Tucker Carlson, is COVID-19 real to him or not? From what I have read through Carlsons article he states the Biden administration is only for political gain, China created the COVID-19 virus, and masking children is detrimental to their health. There has been no study shown that masking children is detrimental to their health. Rather the virus was created in China or not, it is still here. The Biden administration has no political gain, why would the government want a pandemic for elections?\n",
            "During the Trump administration the wearing of mask was not required at the time, but this was because of the shortage of masks, this was stated in the Wikipedia for politics. One could see this as a political gain because the most diehard of fans would follow through with what the Trump administration states. By not wearing a mask the spread of COVID-19 would infect more causing the election to be mailed out to the households.\n",
            "In the article by Maureen Downey, it states that the 2021-22 school year for Georgia, Cobb has a policy that encourages masks, but is not requiring them for in-person learning. The debate around masking is choice and is not a terrible thing. Many send their children to school knowing they might get sick, or even bring the virus home to a fragile family member. district leaders and elected officials could just choice to do the right thing, by just implementing the wearing of a face mask. Charis Granger-Mbugua says that it is hard for a child to wear a mask all day when she sees her peers are not. In relation to this, Tucker Carlson states that it is detrimental for a child to wear a mask all day long.\n",
            "Children under the age of 2 should not wear masks, according to the CDC. As of Sept. 13,2021, there are 42 U.S. states and territories that do not have state/territories mask mandates per the U.S. News article.

Fully vaccinated should were a mask in crowded outdoor settings, and activities that involve any kind of close contact with others not fully vaccinated.\n",
            "This is my own point of view on why there should or should not be a mask mandate. I am 100 percent behind the mask mandate because if a mask can keep me safe as well as my family safe from COVID-19 I am all for it. I do not need to know what is in the cool aid before I drink it, as longs I am safe and my family. They can put whatever they want in the wahoo juice I will still drink/take, as long as it save lives. I may not be the first person to take it because you obviously want to see if it works on other people before taking a new vaccine developed by the government.\n",

            "At 18 years old I became certified as [redacted]. This opened many doors of opportunities for me such as dual college credit, employment opportunities, advancement in my employment, and a substantial amount of knowledge on how to save a life. With the help of high school offering STEM related classes such as this one, it has prepared me for my career in [redacted] as well as gain exceptional amount of experience that has been beneficial throughout my time leading up to becoming a [redacted].\n",
            "In 2001, the acronym STEM (Science, Math, Engineering, Mathematics), was first introduced at the U. S National Science Foundation by the scientific administrators, previously went by SMET. According to Wyatt Dalton in his article, ‚ÄúWhat Is STEM?‚Äù he defines STEM education as the amalgamate of subjects containing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math that teaches the four subjects tied together into one program. STEM offers creative ways to incorporate study methods and ways to solve real world problems. Students attending California Institute of Technology has the opportunity to engage in producing cutting edge technology and innovative discoveries. With large portion of STEM programs being hands on, students learn skills by doing on their own. Some of the largest field of STEM is computing with a little over 70% careers. The second largest field falls under Engineering and Physical Science. These careers consist of Orthodontist, Nurses, Biochemist, & Civil Engineers. Even though mathematics and science make up smaller portions of the fields in STEM it makes up a third of STEM careers.\n",
            "In another article by Elisabeth McClure, she makes the claim STEM is important for all children in all subject areas in the article, ‚Äú4 Things Everyone Should Know About Early Stem Learning.‚Äù This framework provides students with conceptualization and real-life instructions that offer critical thinking experiences and problem-solving skills that will follow throughout adolescent life and will be relevant in when dealing with real world problems. Children of all ages can have the opportunity to learn STEM skills and habits from everyday play or learning activities. In the same article by Elisabth McClure, it discusses how a child can begin to collect data, develop different approaches to problem solving, and adjust to tough situations at young ages. It further explains how one researcher put to reality, the equivalent number of scientific practices that high school students could do, children younger in age were capable of doing as well. Documents also shown children being able to conduct systemic experiments in the first years of life. The job market for STEM careers continues to grow based on an article by Ryan titled, ‚ÄúWhy Is STEM Important? Why Do We Keep Talking About It.‚Äù? Even with the vacancies in certain areas in STEM, STEM jobs will continue to evolve. The author also claims a powerful link connecting STEM to early childhood. Further explains studying STEM skills early have an impact on children by prepping them for school and future career paths.\n",
            "Behind The Scenes of STEM Education\n",
            "In the article, ‚ÄúWhy We Need More Young People In Stem- And How We Can Do It‚Äù by Alistair Cox discusses the different approaches to take in order to influence more opportunities towards a STEM education as well as the importance. The article further explains the needs for revision in the curricula to remain relevant to the 21st century. Some revisions include adequate time educating students on the copious work labor industry and applying the skills learned into the work industry. Without the revision new apprenticeships such as the UKs are at risk of delivering a bad reputation towards STEM education.\n",
            "The author begins to use reasoning to persuade readers by influencing the change to help countless young individuals with having a better work industry then previous generation. This is done by the author emphasizing the growth from individuals with quality skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by crossing subjects and discovering new ways to forecast the weather with data and detecting illnesses with wearable technology. The author makes the bias statement that more students that are female need to be interested in STEM because a percentage of the female population in STEM has decreased even though the jobs have increased since 1990.\n",
            "Another bias statement the author makes is that individuals are resistance to the subject‚Äôs math and science because they are seen as uninteresting or to challenging.\n",
            "The Reasonings & Thoughts behind STEM Education\n",
            "Alistair shows credibility by sharing an experience with a student. Student expressed appreciation in video games but dispersed STEM employment opportunities. After detailed conversation over creation of video games, this resulted in students‚Äô connection and interest in engineering. He also shows credibility by sharing the apprenticeship he was a part of, the British Aerospace, aeronautical engineering and sharing the emotions and benefits from the aerospace. According to the article, students that job-shadowed in STEM environments had a higher influence choosing a path in a STEM career. Author begins to use emotions by explaining how companies can integrate ‚ÄòBring Your Child to Work‚Äô days. This will be introducing the children of the employees to the STEM workplace at an early age. Readers can be intrigued by this especially if they have young ones they support.\n",
            "Joseph Lanthan defines STEAM as the educational subjects that intrigue students in Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Math in the article titled ‚ÄúWhy STEM Is So Important To 21st Century Education.‚Äù Students educated under the STEAM framework are introduced to other helpful skills besides just the subjects of STEAM such as gaining understanding how to learn, asking questions, and ways of creativity and experimentation. This composes students to work in fields that are destined for growth. The arts were later added to STEM regarding recognition and creative ways to solve problems, combine propositions and convey information. In this article the author shows biased by saying STEAM education prepares students with skills and to see the bigger picture with solutions because readers may develop emotions towards statement if a traditional education was received by the reader. The author establishes credibility by offering many resources and activities to begin exploring the world of STEAM. The author also offers a list of opportunities to receive scholarships along with STEAM Grants for schools to incorporate STEAM education. This can be a steppingstone for those that spark an interest in STEM related careers but unaware n how to get there. Lastly the author expresses emotions by stating the faults in the education system. These faults including children unable to solve real-world problems, and lack of group activities.\n",
            "In the Article ‚ÄúStop Pushing STEM‚Äù by Dana Albert, the author proclaims the disbelief that a greater income doesn‚Äôt come from STEM, and the chances of finding a job with STEM education doesn‚Äôt increase. The article also gives doubts about STEMS importance to students. The author Dana Albert shows biased with the graphs he uses to incorporate how jobs play out over time. This shows biased because the graph assumes that everyone is great at each job which is known to not always be true. Emotions are shown to attract readers when the author begins making analogies to cats versus dogs by stating you wouldn‚Äôt treat a cat the same way as a dog so why do it to humans. Making that connection with readers gives the readers the impression to feel guilty. Another act where emotions are displayed is when the author expresses the mental health conditions obtained from constant pressure of opinions by adults. The author also mentions kids who are not given the opportunity to establish self-identity, more kids end up experiencing depression, anxiety, emptiness, and even substance abuse. This is credibly since the author also states the key factor for happiness in a person results from job security and the income it brings. Credibility is also displayed by author when talking about students having to study STEM to get a well-paying job to live in certain communities. The author uses neighbors as an example explaining the decrease in their STEM background but still able to afford living in the community.\n",
            "After reviewing multiple sources over the emphasis of STEM education, I believe it is necessary for students to have early exposure to STEM related activities. Working in an elementary school I see first-hand how students exhibit different skills throughout the day. Many students lack basic skills. In some instances, children have complained about the challenges they are being faced with instead of using critical thinking and problem-solving skills to face the challenge head on. I also believe early introduction to STEM is a great opportunity for students to decide what career field they would like to pursue into adulthood. As previously stated, I became certified as an EMT-B, this opened many doors of opportunities for me at just 18 years old. With the STEM course it has given me the opportunity to see what I like and dislike in the medical field. For example, deciding to be [redacted], or pursue my goals as being a [redacted]. Some other accomplishments I have benefited from taking this course is earning different certificates such as CPR, and weapons of mass destruction, as well as an opportunity to join the [redacted]. I am thankful for the opportunity I was given in high school as it has prepared me for my future career path in [redacted].\n",
            "As parents we lead by example to our children. By partaking in STEM related activities or careers this can be influential to children without even knowing it when they see us setting goals and achieving them. For example, I am currently in school for [redacted]. My daughter has seen all the hard work I have dedicated to my education and future career. She has also experienced the knowledge I obtained first had and has sparked interest in the medical field. Just from my daughter observing my actions she has decided she wants to become a veterinarian and I support her decision 100%.\n",
            "However, some sources displayed some weaker and stronger points related to STEM education. In the article, ‚ÄúWhy Is STEM Important? Why Do We Keep Talking About It?‚Äù the author Ryan makes a stony point by saying, ‚Äúwe need to first educate in order to educate.‚Äù We are the first teacher to our children and with the lack of a parent‚Äôs knowledge on STEM I believe this can significantly impact the choices made by our children and the futures to come. Based on my experience as stated in the last paragraph I believe this to be true. Another interesting point one of the articles made was the growth of individuals predicting weather and discovering illnesses with technology. Technology has advanced tremendously and being able to incorporate the use of technology to potentially save lives of individuals is amazing. Some of the weaker points the sources mentioned was that females need to be more interested in STEM. You can‚Äôt force something onto a person. Regardless of if they are female or male, an individual has that right to decide whether a STEM career would best suite them. I believe a reason there isn‚Äôt many females in STEM careers is because of the stereotype put on females that females can‚Äôt put in the same effort of work in as males could. Another weaker point a source makes is those students uninterest in math and science. This is weak to me because there are multiple jobs that have to do with math, science, or both and not all those jobs are boring. Nursing for example is mixed with both and I have learned about many interesting things from classes that required the use of these subjects.\n",

            "In STEM education a significant amount is based on science and mathematics. A 3rd of STEM careers consists of Life science and mathematics. Some common occupations in this field consists of clinical research associates or economists. This can be tedious work which requires strict commitment and motivation to remain focused throughout coursework.\n",
            "Due to technology advancement, employers are willing to offer exceptional salaries to recent graduates. According to Wyatt Dalton careers in computing make up about 70% of STEM careers. For example, these may consist of software developers, or computer system analysts. With daily lives becoming reliant on digital devices and different software‚Äôs, careers in computing will be predominant. The next largest category of STEM careers is engineering.

This education teaches critical thinking and ways of adapting to new life situations. Besides the accommodating skills acquired, travel can be another benefit from receiving a STEM education. This creates more job opportunities and ways to create life experiences. According to Ankita Nagpal, certain countries are offering more career opportunities for STEM graduates. Some of those countries being US, Ireland, and New Zealand. Ireland also offers the lifetime opportunity to become a permeant resident after graduating and working consistently for two years. Another reason to receive a STEM education is to have latest access to developments. With STEM careers on the rise the compensation received for the work has become financially beneficial as well. This allows years of earnings to rank up and allows more time to save money. From the experience obtained throughout the years and savings leads to opportunity for early retirement. Along with retirement it gives the opportunity to travel the world or become own businessperson. As previously stated, technology on the rise, STEM education is becoming more important for the economy. Based on Yeti Acadamey, by 2028 employment is projected to increase by 8% in STEM occupations. This provides a tremendous amount of opportunities to those willing to do the work.\n",

            "After reviewing multiple sources over STEM education and the importance of it I believe it is necessary for the future of generations to experience activities related to STEM. Working in an elementary school I see first-hand how students exhibit different skills throughout the day. I see many students react fearful when introduced with a question they may not know the answer to. In some instances, children have complained about the challenges they begin facing instead of using critical thinking and problem-solving skills to face the challenge head on. As discussed in previous articles, I also believe early introduction to STEM is a great opportunity for students to ponder on what they would like to pursue for a living as an adult. This also gives them an opportunity to see what they like and dislike. As a senior in high school, I had the opportunity to partake in a STEM related class. This opened many doors of opportunities for me at just 18 years old. Some of those opportunities being certificates earned and used as accomplishments on resume‚Äôs or in interviews. I was also offered employment opportunities based on my credentials I earned in my STEM related class. As parents we lead by example to our children. By partaking in STEM related activities or careers this can be influential to children without even knowing when they see their parents achieving their goals. For example, I am currently in school for [redacted]. My daughter has seen all the hard work I have dedicated to my education. She has also experienced the knowledge I obtained first had and has sparked interest in the medical field. Just from my daughter evaluating me she has decided she wants to be a veterinarian and I support her decision 100%.\n",
            "However, some sources displayed some weaker and stronger points related to STEM education. In the article, ‚ÄúWhy Is STEM Important? Why Do We Keep Talking About It?‚Äù the author Ryan makes a good point by stating ‚Äúwe need to first educate in order to educate.‚Äù As parents we are the first teachers to our children, with the lack of a parent‚Äôs knowledge on STEM I believe this can significantly impact the future of our youth. Based on my experience as stated in the last paragraph I believe this to be true. Another interesting point one of the articles made was the growth of individuals predicting weather and discovering illnesses with technology. Technology has advanced tremendously and being able to incorporate the use of technology to potentially save lives of individuals is amazing. Some of the weaker points the sources mentioned was that females need to be more interested in STEM. You can‚Äôt force something onto a person. Regardless of if they are female or male, an individual has that right to decide whether a STEM career would best suite them. Another weaker point a source makes uninterest in math and science. This is weak to me because there are multiple jobs that have to do with math, science, or both and not all those jobs are boring. Nursing for example is mixed with both and I have learned about many interesting things from classes that required the use these two.\n",

            "      Mask Mandate Purpose and Solution\n",
            "What is the mask mandate?  The mask mandate is the mandating of wearing a mask out in public to avoid the spreading of Covid-19.  People all around the world have been wearing face masks for a while now, the US is one of the only countries that just recently started doing the same to prevent the spread of diseases such as the one we are facing today.  However, many still argue about the effectiveness of wearing a facemask in general, while others support it wholeheartedly.  Whichever side you may be on we can‚Äôt run away from the fact that if there was a mandate, and we would need to follow it whether we like it or not.  This would include wearing it out in public and at restaurants, or pretty much anywhere where you may have to interact with others.  However, there are exceptions to these rules, according to Wikipedia children that are under 2 years old don‚Äôt have to wear a mask and neither do people with any kind of respiratory problem, and or someone who is unable to remove a facemask from their face.\n",
            "Now while the mask mandate isn‚Äôt in effect anymore here in Indiana there are still some states that require it.  According to Usnews.com these are the list of the states mandating mask regulation regardless of vaccination as of October 2021, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington.  These states only require you to wear a mask if you‚Äôre not vaccinated and they are California, New York and Connecticut.   So, from what we can gather here out of the 50 states in America not including our other territories, only 11 out of the 50 require a mask mandate and out of those 11 only 3 are exempt to those who already have their set of covid vaccine shots.\n",
            "According to Jama Network mask mandates are enforced not just to defend the wearers of the mask themselves but also the people around them.  The website also states that when we all have facemasks on, we‚Äôre safe and run a lower risk of anyone getting sick.  They, later, go on to state on a optimistic note that no matter what may come out of this, one way or another this will help us further control any future pandemics and learn about the mistakes from the past and current situations and the importance of mask mandates.  Many however don‚Äôt agree and believe that people who are vaccinated against covid won‚Äôt get sick again shouldn‚Äôt have to wear a mask and those who don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine in general shouldn‚Äôt be forced to wear a mask at all.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs take a dive into three articles all speaking their minds on the mask mandate and their point of views on this to further understand what sides we have and further educational purposes.  The first was from ajc.com where a mother was practically begging the school district to make it mandatory to wear a mask.  She argued that we run a greater risk to catch the delta variant than the regular common cold, flu, seasonal allergies, all those commonly spread illnesses.  She made a strong point speaking out on the fact that there are a lot of people who are more susceptible to getting sick that could greatly be affected from Covid due to their children or even faculty staff members bringing it home and not even knowing it.  She ends it with her  realistic assessment on the situation and that being ‚ÄúNot everyone will be happy, I know; but temporary happiness pales in comparison to a life spread‚Äù.  This article stands firmly on the mask mandate point of view, the author of this article want to touch heart strings and used an emotional appeal to win over support for a mask mandate.\n",
            "The second source I researched was foxnews.com.  At fox news where Tucker Carlson starts off with a strong opposing argument, ‚ÄúSo the vaccines work, the only people getting sick are the unvaccinated, but the vaccinated still have to wear masks. Why is that?‚Äù.   He states that basically why do people who are vaccinated must wear masks if they are ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù immune to Covid-19?  And if the people who don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine don‚Äôt want to wear the face mask that is their problem and theirs only.  He goes off topic from making a decent emotional appeal case, to blaming the democrats for all of this, he says they‚Äôre using the mask mandate to seize control of the country and how this is all a political movement to earn favor in the public‚Äôs eye.   The author of this article the being Tucker Carlson also uses emotional appeal to support his views on the mask mandate policy.  The article makes a good apposing point to the previous one however, when it mentions how it is redundant to wear a mask if you‚Äôre already vaccinated.  He is arguing strongly the fact that it doesn‚Äôt matter, they‚Äôre making it seem like a big deal just to show us the public that they‚Äôre doing a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù.\n",
            "The last source comes from nature.com, where Anne Hoen, an epidemiologist states that she believes that the mask mandates were removed too briefly and prematurely.  And this mind you is with Vermont being one of the lower rates of hospitalizations when it comes to Covid-19.  The author of the website being Lynne Peeples a science journalist, believes that we are on the opposite side when it comes to mask mandate in our country, other countries such as Germany have strengthened their mask mandate whereas we are trending in the opposite direction.\n",
            "A study using reliable statistics like this was done in the USA where it was alarmingly discovered that a mask mandate could‚Äôve prevented up to almost 50% of deaths.  But you must also consider this strong assessment made by John Brownstein, an epidemiologist states that, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between government policy and community buy-in.‚Äù  It would all depend on how the public handle this and just how strictly a mask mandate would be followed if there were to be one, that would be the difference on it making an impact or not according to John.  If we analyze what Tucker stated, that vaccinations should be the answer to mask mandate, and we look at what Germany did you can argue that there‚Äôs two strong opposing viewpoints.  One who doesn‚Äôt want to wear masks and believes that either you‚Äôre vaccinated and are protected against it, or you run your own risk if you‚Äôre not.  Or the other viewpoint where regardless of vaccination status to further prevent the spread of it a mask mandate should be enforced for the safety of others and the less fortunate who can‚Äôt get a vaccination just yet.\n",
            "For starters let‚Äôs weigh our options here, on the first hand you have the first article that states emotional heart strings which involve the endangerment of children and other faculty members.  While it does have some truth to it doesn‚Äôt it seem a little bit of a stretch?  Why don‚Äôt we just wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want to get sick and not wear one if that isn‚Äôt something that we are concerned about?  The Wikipedia article mentioned about the mask mandate protocol and rules state that children under 2 don‚Äôt have to wear it, neither do people with health complications, but what about people who just don‚Äôt want to wear a mask on their face?   Well after a little bit of research and information from https://www.statista.com we can see that Louisiana having a face mask mandate has a higher death rate per capita than Indiana by 67, Indiana having 240 and Louisiana having 307.  Indiana also has a bigger population sitting at 6,805,663, and Louisiana having 4,627,002.  Normally a state with more people should have more deaths than a state with less people, especially if this mask mandate is supposed to ‚Äúwork‚Äù.\n",
            "This would make the article by Jama Network where she states that, wearing a mask protects not only just the user but also the people around them, inaccurate.  How is it then that Louisiana being smaller than Indiana and having a mask mandate has more deaths than Indiana does?  This doesn‚Äôt mean that wearing a mask has anything to do with Covid at all, according to the second article, Tucker stated that it was all just the democrats seize of power from the public eye.  If this is the case, then isn‚Äôt the nation already divided as it is?  They can‚Äôt surely expect to please one side and win the favor of the whole nation, that‚Äôs not how it works nor how it‚Äôll ever work.  For example, look at last year, just last year there was division in the USA the greatest we‚Äôve seen in a while, there isn‚Äôt any way that this mask mandate will make us all see the same and agree on the same thing.  We‚Äôre humans, it‚Äôs just something we can‚Äôt do is all agree on one thing.   Could we perhaps come in the middle here and not take everyone‚Äôs freedom of choice and expression away?  I don‚Äôt doubt in the importance of wearing a mask out in public, the last article where it states that mask‚Äôs being better worn alone could‚Äôve prevented up to 50% of deaths in the USA alone.\n",
            "Those are alarming numbers, and I could potentially see how the masks could‚Äôve helped which leads to an even bigger question.  Was it the lack of masks, or was it the quality of masks?  Those hospital masks weren‚Äôt very effective, and a lot of people don‚Äôt even know that now which is why they‚Äôre still getting sick even with masks on.  The cloth ones don‚Äôt get properly washed and hold on the bacteria collected in the air that you breath constantly once the mask is on.  I personally believe in one thing and one thing only, equality.  We should be able to compromise on whichever side we‚Äôre on.  Let‚Äôs face the facts, there isn‚Äôt much information out yet about this pandemic and if masks are even effective this is a crisis we face today as a society, we all must embark in this part of history.  But if it is one thing to keep everyone happy, we must go about this equally.  We should be able to wear a mask if we want to, or not wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want to.  Let whoever wants to wear a mask wear it, whether they‚Äôre vaccinated or not.\n",
            "At the end of the day, it‚Äôs our health that the government is worried about, but we should also be in control of our health and what happens to our bodies.  With more education, and more awareness on this situation we could just compensate on both ends and not discriminate one another for believing in one thing vs the other.  At the end of the day, it should just come down to your opinion, it is your right.\n",

            "What is the mask mandate?  The mask mandate is the mandating of wearing a mask out in public to avoid the spreading of Covid-19.  People all around the world have been wearing face masks for a while now, the US is one of the only countries who just recently started doing the same to prevent the spread of diseases such as the one we are facing today.  However, many still argue about the effectiveness of wearing a facemask in general, while others support it wholeheartedly.  Whichever side you may be on we can‚Äôt run away from the fact that it is a mandate, and we need to follow it whether we like it or not.  However, there are exceptions to these rules, according to Wikipedia children that are under 2 years old don‚Äôt have to wear a mask and neither do people with any kind of respiratory problem and or someone is unable to remove a facemask from their face.\n",
            "The evidence, according to University of California San Francisco,  to wear a facemask is the following, after doing some laboratory studies on face masks and droplets to see how many would be caught vs not caught, they found that nearly all droplets were blocked from leaving the mask.  This further backs the claim of the importance of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of disease.   They later go into detail about the percentage decrease of Covid-19 spread with a facemask mandate, it showed that after just five days it dropped in .9 percent and after two weeks more than 2 percent.  The website later stats that a man who tested positive for Covid-19 was on a plane with 25 other passengers but because he we forced to wear a facemask none of the passengers in that plane got Covid.\n",
            "Sometimes all we may need is a lawful enforcement for our own good, according to Jama Network mask mandates are enforced not just to defend the wearers of the mask themselves but also the people around them.  The website also states that when we all have facemasks on, we‚Äôre safe and run a lower risk of anyone getting sick.  They, later, go on to state on a positive not that no matter what may come out of this, one way or another this will help us further control any future pandemics and learn about the mistakes from the past and current situations and the importance of mask mandates.\n",

He goes on to blame the democrats for all of this, he say‚Äôs they‚Äôre using the mask mandate to seize control of the country and how this is all a political movement to earn favor in the public‚Äôs eye.   He also states that there isn‚Äôt a point of having a republican party at all whatsoever since the Biden administration has complete control of this and they‚Äôre basically getting what they want and more which is a mask mandate.

He stated that, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between government policy and community buy-in.‚Äù  It would all depend on how the public handle this and just how strictly a mask mandate would be followed if there were to be one, that would be the difference on it making an impact or not according to John.  If we look back on what Tucker stated that vaccinations should be the answer to mask mandate, and we look at what Germany did you can argue that there‚Äôs two strong opposing viewpoints.  One who doesn‚Äôt want to wear masks and believes that either you‚Äôre vaccinated and are protected against it, or you run your own risk if you‚Äôre not.  Or the other viewpoint where regardless of vaccination status to further prevent the spread of it a mask mandate should be enforced for the safety of others and the less fortunate who can‚Äôt get a vaccination just yet.\n",
            "For starters let‚Äôs weigh our options here, on the first hand you have the fourth article that states emotional heart strings which involve the endangerment of children and other faculty members.  While it does have some truth to it doesn‚Äôt it seem a little bit of a stretch?  Why don‚Äôt we just wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want to get sick and not wear one if that isn‚Äôt something that we are concerned about?  The first article mentioned about the mask mandate protocol and rules state that children under 2 don‚Äôt have to wear it, neither do people with health complications, but what about people who just don‚Äôt want to wear a mask on their face?   Well after a little bit of research and information from coronavirus.in.gov and www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics I found out some surprising numbers.  Illinois as mentioned before has a mask mandate, and surprisingly they have around 25,153 covid related deaths whereas, Indiana does not have a mask mandate, their covid related deaths are around 15,442.  Which further begs the question do masks even make a difference with helping with the spread of Covid-19?\n",
            "This would make the third article by Jama Network where she states that, wearing a mask protects not only just the user but also the people around them, inaccurate.  How is it then that Illinois being right next to Indiana and having a mask mandate has more deaths than Indiana does?  This doesn‚Äôt mean that wearing a mask has anything to do with Covid at all, according to the fifth article, Tucker stated that it was all just the democrats seize of power from the public eye.  If this is the case, then isn‚Äôt the nation already divided as it is?  They can‚Äôt surely expect to please one side and win the favor of the whole nation, that‚Äôs not how it works nor how it‚Äôll ever work.  For example, look at last year, just last year there was division in the USA the greatest we‚Äôve seen in a while, there isn‚Äôt any way that this mask mandate will make us all see the same and agree on the same thing.  We‚Äôre humans, it‚Äôs just something we can‚Äôt do is all agree on one thing.   Could we perhaps come in the middle here and not take everyone‚Äôs freedom of choice and expression away?  I don‚Äôt doubt in the importance of wearing a mask out in public, the last article where it states that mask‚Äôs being better worn alone could‚Äôve prevented up to 50% of deaths in the USA alone.\n",
            "Those are alarming numbers, and I could potentially see how the masks could‚Äôve helped which leads to an even bigger question.  Was it the lack of masks, or was it the quality of masks?  Those hospital masks weren‚Äôt very effective, and a lot of people don‚Äôt even know that now which is why they‚Äôre still getting sick even with masks on.  The cloth ones don‚Äôt get properly washed and hold on the bacteria collected in the air that you breath constantly once the mask is on.  I personally believe in one thing and one thing only, equality.  We should be able to compromise on whichever side we‚Äôre on.  Let‚Äôs face the facts, there isn‚Äôt much information out yet about this pandemic and if masks are even effective this is a crisis we face today as a society, we all must embark in this part of history.  But if it is one thing to keep everyone happy, we must go about this equally.  We should be able to wear a mask if we want to, or not wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want to.  Let whoever wants to wear a mask wear it, whether they‚Äôre vaccinated or not.\n",
            "At the end of the day, it‚Äôs our health that the government is worried about, but we should also be in control of our health and what happens to our bodies.  With more education, and more awareness on this situation we could just compensate on both ends and not discriminate one another for believing in one thing vs the other.  At the end of the day, it should just come down to your opinion, it is your right.\n",

            "      What is the purpose of the mask mandate?\n",
            "When it comes to the mask mandate and Covid-19 everyone has their own opinion. Some people are invested into using every resource possible to prevent the contact of this disease, while others\n",
            "simply do not believe in this disease or care to prevent it. COVID-19 became the number one topic in the United States since 2020 of last year. This topic is the gossip of every local news station, social media website, radio, talk show, and newspaper article. This disease caused the world to breakout into a panic that led to many different changes. The most noticeable change was the mask mandate.\n",
            "The mask mandate started as a statewide requirement to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n",
            "Every state had a different date for this requirement and Indiana‚Äôs mandate started on July 27, 2020. Now in the year of 2021 and the month of September, the circumstances have drastically.\n",
            "changed. Even though our current President Joe Biden wants to make the mask mandate nationwide, he is not able to order this mandate. Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown University‚Äôs O‚ÄôNeill Institute for National and Global Law said, ‚ÄúA national mandate is not possible because public health powers belong to the states, not federal government.‚Äù The mask was not only enforced to protect individuals, but the public. Some states still hold a mask mandate, but currently in the state of Indiana there is no mask mandate. Governor Eric Holcomb cancelled the mandate on April 6, 2021, but masks are still required to be worn in schools‚Äô grades K-12, government buildings and vaccination or covid testing sites. The virus is airborne through particles and droplets of fluid that are exhaled from person to person. Also, the virus can lead to infection through close contact through people. The face mask mandate stimulated from this discovery.\n",
            "The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) suggests that all members of the public, regardless of their vaccination status to wear a mask in crowded places indoors. The vaccine allows people the ability to resume their lives before the pandemic. The mask is to be worn while using different forms of public transportation. There are certain places you are prevented from entering if you do not have on a mask. The mask is just one of the protective ways to stop the spread of covid from people outside your home. The mask is suggested to be worn by people who are older than two years old. Wearing a mask is difficult for people with disabilities and young children. However, masks are not necessary to wear when you are outside away from others, or in your household.\n",
            "There are many different types of masks that are designed to protect individuals from the virus. Cloth masks are made from multiple layers that fit properly over your face. Disposable masks are the standard mask that is widely used with easy access to breath and talk through. Respirators are masks that have been tested to meet international standards. These masks are made specially for diseases like Covid. They are more smug, harder to breathe in, cannot be washed, and more expensive to buy. You can even get creative and have your mask homemade with design, pockets, glitter, paint, letters, etc. Health professionals suggest that you wear the mask correctly\n",
            "with your and mouth completely covered. Your mask should also be secured behind your ears with loops. Any mask is acceptable if you meet the requirements.\n",
            "The restrictions of the mask mandate have changed, but face masks are still stressed across the country. An example of this is children being able to attend school and the administration working to teach students, but with face masks on. This has caused many people like Tucker Carlson to question the quality of the vaccination because they want their lives back to normal before the pandemic happened. Public health officials have taken extra precaution in making sure the vaccine works in protecting us.\n",
            "The tone of this portion in the article includes anger and frustration. Many Americans are confused about the Biden Administration wanting to increase restrictions. The vaccination works and the purpose is to help protect many from the virus but, they are not seeing any results. The author claims the government is being unfair in not giving us the choice of choosing to take the vaccination. A big study in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that COVID vaccines offer a higher level of protection against the new delta variant of virus. The author believes that Biden Administration is trying to control people politically by instilling fear into them to take the virus and wear a mask.\n",
            "However, this claim cannot be supported because it is an opinion about how he feels towards the situation. There is no evidence to justify this claim. The article is not a good source because it is based on what he thinks and wants done. He also seems to think he is the voice of reason for all Americans by creating his own statements of what people are saying. There are no statements of other people‚Äôs dislike toward this situation, just his thoughts and opinions. Tucker is also closed minded and commenting irrational things that cannot be used as evidence for an argument. He comments things like we live in a world with crazy people running our country. He also stated ‚Äú‚ÄúA rational administration would make vaccinations available to anyone who wants one and leave the rest of the population alone to lives their lives ‚Äì like they used to do in America back when it was a free country.‚Äù\n",
            "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article is sharing a story of a former teacher Charis Granger ‚Äì Mbugua feelings throughout the journey of sending her two young children back to school, where there is no mask mandate. What used to start off as anticipation quickly turned into worry and fear for her children. Many parents can relate to the feeling of unknown when your child is not in your care or view. Some school and state districts do not choose to put guidelines in place, despite health protocols. They instead leave the decision up to the people in whether they want to wear a mask or not.\n",
            "She states twice in the article that many people are not able to make a choice in withdrawing their kids from school or afford health care if hospitalization is needed to protect their families. This statement is true because there is an article on children of color disproportionally impacted by severe COVID-19 illness and death. The article is adamant in trying to get the readers to understand the point of view in this parent‚Äôs concern of her children‚Äôs health and others while attending school. The article is emotionally attachable because you can feel the mother‚Äôs passion as she uses words like ‚ÄúI am begging.‚Äù This could be a great source to use for people who want a mask mandate and think everyone should continue to wear a mask.\n",
            "When the covid rates started dropping and the vaccination was offered, nature news article was surprised just like every other American. Yet this was another change American people had to adapt too. The status of Covid-19 has put many people in positions they did not expect to be in. No one could have enough time to prepare for this virus. States across the world are struggling with the decision to set their own policies of a mask mandate. Some countries like China quickly adapted to the mask mandate, while other countries like Germany waited on officials to commence the mandate. Masks are used as a protective barrier, but not all masks are the same. Masks come from different cloth and certain mask are made specifically to cover your face, while others are just for fashion. There are mask guidelines that help you determine acceptable masks to wear.\n",
            "This article is giving the audience different opinions and views from many different backgrounds. It is very culturally based and fair in giving everybody a chance in explaining their view on this topic. The article involves a lot of background research that focuses on several different countries, including the United States. The author is trying to get us to understand the science behind the mask mandate by including stats and data to support the topic. The article is fair with an even tone that is stating more facts than opinions. By reading this article, I understand the topic through a different perspective.\n",
            "Although the purpose of wearing a mask is to protect individuals, it should be a choice for the individual to make. The government does not hold enough power to enforce individuals to do things they are not comfortable with. Wearing a mask can be beneficial to some people and suffocating to others. The discussion of masks has created a division amongst the government, American people, politics, and science. Covid has completely changed our way of living. We have heard the stories, seen the headlines, and even witnessed how this mask mandate continues to be a worldwide debate.\n",
            "Wearing a mask does help prevent the spread of diseases but is also not 100% effective in stopping you from catching the disease. Wearing a mask is just one efficient way of protection. There are other necessary measures you must take to slow the spread of the disease like, social distancing, consistently washing your hands, and getting vaccinated. Many scientists have relied on testing different masks on how effective they are against other masks. There is evidence that wearing face masks has been helpful. Covid cases and death rates have decreased in several states. This has caused government officials to be lenient in dropping the mask guidelines. This decision has made some people happy and others concerned about their safety.\n",
            "There are some people still choosing to wear a mask. People who continue to keep their mask on reasons extend beyond their health. NBC news has an article that talks about why people are considering wearing for social reasons. Some people might describe that wearing a mask offers them some form of peace. Face masks have not only helped people dodge the bullet of being sick but helped them hide their emotions from others around them. Jaz Johnson is a perfect example of this statement by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been pretty fun now that no one really knows, necessarily, what I‚Äôm thinking.‚Äù Often being in public settings can cause a form of anxiety, self-consciousness, and fear. Examples of these forms of emotions are being in a crowded public place like the grocery store, the thought of you being watched and judged by people, and fear of embarrassing yourself in public by falling. Another major reason of why people continue to wear face masks is to protect members of the elderly in their family safe. Some additional minor reasons may be to reduce the stress of having to put on makeup and not having to consistently smile.\n",
            "People who are against wearing masks all the time hope that masks do not become a permanent lifestyle. Wearing a mask can be offensive toward outside people. Most masks cover your entire and some people would even say that they feel isolated from society. The outbreak of the coronavirus was a lot to bare and caused many stressful situations in people lives. A lot of families spent time apart for months, endured the pain of watching loved lives become infected with the virus, or even suffered through the complications of the virus themselves. Regarding of the many sources and articles to choose from with information, many people still have their own opinion of the topic. There is still not enough convincing evidence for people to completely believe in wearing a mask or taking the vaccine. Anti-mask advocates find that wearing a mask is pointless and does not work. There have been many cases where people who consistently wear a mask, social distance themselves from others, and do all necessary actions to keep germs to a minimum still have been affected by covid.\n",
            "The mask mandate is an ongoing controversial topic that has everyone wanting to state their opinion. Everyone should have the right to choose what they want to do to protect themselves. The option of a mask should be an open discussion to everyone. This open can help the American people adapt better to future changes to come happening politically involving the government. The debate is more fun when more people are involved. I believe that people can make the right decision that benefits them. I strongly agree that any and every vote can count towards a beneficial win for the United States.\n",

            "The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) suggests that all members of the public, regardless of their vaccination status to wear a mask in crowded places indoors. The vaccine allows people the ability to resume their lives before the pandemic. The mask is to be worn while using different forms of public transportation. There are certain places you are prevented from entering if you do not have on a mask. The mask is just one of the protective ways to stop the spread of covid from people outside your home. The mask is suggested to be worn by people who are older than two years old. Wearing a mask is difficult for people with disabilities and young children. However, masks are not necessary to wear when you are outside away from others, or in your household.\n",
            "There are many different types of masks that are designed to protect individuals from the virus. Cloth masks are made from multiple layers that fit properly over your face. Disposable masks are the standard mask that is widely used with easy access to breath and talk through. Respirators are masks that have been tested to meet international standards. These masks are made specially for diseases like Covid. They are more smug, harder to breathe in, cannot be washed, and more expensive to buy. You can even get creative and have your mask homemade with design, pockets, glitter, paint, letters, etc. Health professionals suggest that you wear the mask correctly with your and mouth completely covered. Your mask should also be secured behind your ears with loops. Any mask is acceptable if you meet the requirements.\n",

            "The restrictions of the mask mandate have changed, but face masks are still stressed across the country. An example of this is children being able to attend school and the administration working to teach students, but with face masks on. According to an announcement made by the CDC, the health administration will force masks on people regardless of their vaccination status. This has caused many people like Tucker Carlson to question the quality of the vaccination because they want their lives back to normal before the pandemic happened.\n",
            "The tone of this portion in the article includes anger and frustration. Many Americans are confused about the Biden Administration wanting to increase restrictions. The vaccination works and the purpose is to help protect many from the virus but, they are not seeing any results. The author claims the government is being unfair in not giving us the choice of choosing to take the vaccination. ‚ÄúA rational administration would make vaccinations available to anyone who wants one and leave the rest of the population alone to lives their lives ‚Äì like they used to do in America back when it was a free country.‚Äù\n",
            "However, this claim cannot be supported because it is an opinion about how he feels towards the situation. There is no evidence to justify this claim. The article is not a good source because it is based on what he thinks and wants done. He also seems to think he is the voice of reason for all Americans by creating his own statements of what people are saying. There are no statements of other people‚Äôs dislike toward this situation, just his thoughts and opinions. Tucker is also closed minded and commenting irrational things that cannot be used as evidence for an argument.\n",
            "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article is sharing a story of a former teacher Charis Granger ‚Äì Mbugua feelings throughout the journey of sending her two young children back to school, where there is no mask mandate. What used to start off as anticipation quickly turned into worry and fear for her children. Many parents can relate to the feeling of unknown when your child is not in your care or view. Many families have made the decision of whether they should let their children return to school after a year of being at home from COVID-19. Data from cases of covid change daily, which can be difficult in knowing what source to trust. Some school and state districts do not choose to put guidelines in place, despite health protocols. They instead leave the decision up to the people in whether they want to wear a mask or not.\n",
            "Charis‚Äôs decision is clear in having her children wear mask, despite their classmates not wearing one. She has based this decision on what is best in protecting her children, family members, herself, and outsiders. She states twice in the article that many people are not able to make a choice in withdrawing their kids from school or afford health care if hospitalization is needed to protect their families. This statement is true because there is an article on children of color disproportionally impacted by severe COVID-19 illness and death. The article is adamant in trying to get the readers to understand the point of view in this parent‚Äôs concern of her children‚Äôs health and others while attending school. The article is emotionally attachable because you can feel the mother‚Äôs passion as she uses words like ‚ÄúI am begging.‚Äù This could be a great source to use for people who want a mask mandate and think everyone should continue to wear a mask.\n",
            "When the covid rates started dropping and the vaccination was offered nature news article were surprised just like every other American. Yet this was another change American people had to adapt too. The status of Covid-19 has put many people in positions they did not expect to be in. No one could have enough time to prepare for this virus. States across the world are struggling with the decision to set their own policies of a mask mandate.\n",
            "The state of New Hampshire seems to feel as if things have been moving too fast. Erin Perkins a manager of a shop in this state is a witness to this claim. She states that she is not comfortable in changing thing despite the vaccine or mask mandate. Health officials are struggling in being able to tell the different between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Many people are not wearing masks and the rates of COVID-19 are both increasing and decreasing. This article is giving the audience different opinions and views from many different backgrounds.

Some people are invested into using every resource possible to prevent the contact of this disease, while others simply do not believe in this disease or care to prevent it. COVID-19 became the number one topic in the United States since 2020 of last year. This topic is the gossip of every local news station, social media website, radio, talk show, and newspaper article. This disease caused the world to breakout into a panic that led to many different changes. The most noticeable change was the mask mandate.

Even though our current President Joe Biden wants to make the mask mandate nationwide, he is not able to order this mandate.

We have heard the stories, seen the headlines, and even witnessed how this mask mandate continues to be a worldwide debate.\n",

There are other necessary measures you must take to slow the spread of the disease like, social distancing, consistently washing your hands, and getting vaccinated. Many scientists have relied on testing different masks on how effective they are against other masks. There is evidence that wearing face masks has been helpful. Covid cases and death rates has decreased in several states. This has caused government officials to be lenient in dropping the mask guidelines. This decision has made some people happy, and others concerned about their safety.\n",

Many people do not like the idea of wearing a mask, so they often go without one. Not wearing a mask in public is a high risk for unvaccinated people and the public surrounding them. Masks can be difficult to wear for certain people including young children, people who have breathing difficulties, glasses, skin conditions, etc. You have people who are willing to take the necessary action towards following all medical guidelines to protect their health.\n",

            "In 2020 when the Coronavirus pandemic began, I was in a panic. I have two children both in school, my fianc√© and I both working full-time. I was laid off my children then went to virtual learning, but my fianc√© remained working full-time. These uncertain times had many people clueless on what to do. There was very little research and hardly any information, the basic guidelines were to keep a mask on and stay home away from others except for necessities. Now over a year later we do have more information yet we as a country are still very uncertain.\n",
            "In America there have now been two times when masks have been mandated to protect society. As of now masks have become an issue of debate within the last year, with the notable Coronavirus. Before the Coronavirus there was The Spanish Flu. This pandemic began in January 1918 and claimed the lives of over 50 million people by the time it ended in December 1920; masks were very prevalent during these times. According to sources through CNN on October 24, 1918, San Fransisco began the first mask mandate in the United States. After they had begun the mask mandate anyone that was seen outside without a mask could be fined or imprisoned. Trains coming into cities would be met with women that had masks for the travelers in case they were not able to obtain one elsewhere. Masks were heavily implemented throughout the country for everybody‚Äôs health.\n",
            "Mask mandates have come to a head during current times due to the Coronavirus or Covid-19. This virus was first identified in 2019 and is still an ongoing issue. This virus is spread through droplets, which would require mouth covering to keep them from spreading. Sources from John Hopkins state, when infected with Covid-19 you may not portray symptoms immediately or you may be asymptomatic. This could cause others to contract the virus without your knowledge of you being a carrier. The spread of Coronavirus is very easily spread with sources from the Health Lab of Michigan state for every one person that is infected, they will personally infect another 2-3 more people. With the infection rate continuing to grow the use of masks would be mandatory. The long-term effects of this virus are still unknown as they are still making new discoveries daily, but we are certain that it does cause health issues leading up to death.\n",
            "With Covid-19 being easily transmittable mask mandates were put into effect across the United States, with New Jersey being the first of the 50 states to order a mask mandate on April 8th, 2020. Many states followed suit shortly after. All states at this point made their own decisions on when masks were mandatory, or when to lift the mandate. According to CDC Guidelines as of March 8th 2021 anyone that has been fully vaccinated can shed their masks as stated in The Los Angeles Times. This only applied to people that were fully vaccinated. The CDC then states if you are not vaccinated you are still to wear your face covering in all indoor settings and most outdoor settings. As of July 27th, 2021, the CDC recommends anyone that is fully vaccinated or unvaccinated to wear there facial covering as there is a new variant of Coronavirus called the Delta Variant. This would require some who have already been vaccinated to get booster shots.\n",
            "With masks being a central issue for millions of people, you always have people on opposing ends of the spectrum. Some Americans think wearing masks will help save society while others feel it is detrimental to one‚Äôs health or that it could even be politically fueled.\n",
            "Maureen Downey argues in ‚ÄúOpinion: As a mother of young children, I beg Cobb County mandate masks.‚Äù She argues that masks in the school system are needed and should not just be recommended. In this article it is strongly stated that many Americans do not have the funds to deal with the repercussions the virus would hold for their families, especially families of color. The author of this article is very invested in this emotionally as her kids‚Äô health is at stake. This is where she connects with the reader; with quotes like ‚ÄúOur children are too important, their lives too full of promise, to continue in the way we are going.‚Äù Her claims on health are very strong and supported by credible sources, but I do not feel that is the basis of this article. I do feel as though this is more of an emotionally charged article as she fears for the safety of her children; and the community.\n",
            "The article does show the rise of the cases since the masks have been made optional, but she does not show if these numbers stay at this increased number or if they fluctuate. This information is crucial to allow the reader to see how devastating this virus can be at one time, but this article does not make the correlation with ongoing cases. This article is a very biased view of a mask mandate with the opinion of a mother to be treated as fact.\n",
            "From a scientific approach you have an article from Lynne Peeples tilted ‚ÄúWhat science says about lifting mask mandates.‚Äù The fluctuation of masks and vaccinations all vary on demographics. As shown in Germany getting a jump on the mask mandate put a 75% drop in the Covid cases in just 20 days, while other areas lagged behind. When areas are lifting the mask mandates, as many are getting vaccinated, many are still choosing not to get vaccinated.\n",
            "This article appeals to the academic mind as it states many facts with credible sources; this also covers many crucial topics all backed by research. The tone of this article is also very monotone, which helps not create a bias.  I‚Äôve also noticed with this article that they do state information on both sides of wearing a mask. Many facts with many credible sources were used. One example with a credible source was used with the estimation of the deaths that could have been prevented by a mask mandate. Many people still do not know what to do as shown in this article. With mandates being lifted some stores are still implementing the mask mandate to ensure safety, even if it does cause loss of business.\n",
            "This article also uses comparative arguments when comparing to the AIDS/HIV epidemic with the Covid epidemic. They also use studies and a comparative argument on which masks are the most protective, and if cloth masks even protect you. Lynne Peeples is just trying to show in these times there is uncertainty and people should err on the side of caution.\n",
            "Tucker Carlson‚Äôs article titled ‚ÄúNew mask guidelines are about politics and control‚Äù states how the new Biden administration is detrimental to our bodies. In this statement he is trying to relate to the reader with a scare tactic that your health is at risk. Carlson then moves onto state in his article that the Biden administration has determined they will not be making masks mandatory or vaccines mandatory, but Joe Biden (the president) states he would do whatever it takes to encourage people to do the right thing. Now, at this point Biden is making all government employees get vaccinated, and masks are still mandatory in some locations. Carlson is now implementing more information this is backed with a credible source, but all the credible sources are all written by Fox News which is the leading platform of which this article was posted. What is being claimed is the Biden administration used Covid as a scare tactic to get elected into office, using the vaccinated against the unvaccinated. The article states that the representatives are not backing the people to not force vaccinations. As previously Americans were not forced to receive vaccinations they did not want, so why this one? This is a way to make the reader feel they are having no control over what is going on, and the government has full control. The claim he is making is that it is politically fueled. With little evidence, this article does have strong claims but nothing to implement them. This article comes with very few supporting statements as most of the article is opinion. With all the claims being supported by Fox News.\n",
            "The purpose of a mask mandate could still lie unclear for many. All three previous arguments did have valid arguments, but were they strong and credible? In my opinion I weigh in the middle ground of mandating masks, with my answer not being so clear. I think this is where most people stand. I personally do believe that there is a time and place when masks are needed, yet we shouldn‚Äôt wear them at all times.\n",
            "As shown in the first arguments by Maureen Downey there are many children that are contracting the virus once mask mandates are lifted. These children are not able to receive the vaccines. You then have the article by Tucker Carlson which states wearing masks is hurting our health ‚Äúmillions of children will be required to cover their faces- this despite the scientifically established fact that masks pose a greater risk than Covid, both arguments are very crucial. What do we do if our kids are getting sick because they aren‚Äôt wearing masks? On the opposing end if we are wearing the masks are they going to make us sick too, which one is worse?\n",
            "The article by Lynne Peeples shows the confusion caused by mask mandates, vaccines and ultimately the Corona Virus. Many people are scared and don‚Äôt know what to do especially when it comes to their health. You would think the most obvious answer would be to wear a mask, but when you have research showing that breathing in your own air all day is not good for you, what do you do? The purpose of a mask mandate is to keep yourself and the people around you healthy and to stop the spread of contractable virus, but if only some people are wearing them and you only wear them on certain occasions, does it really apply? In my opinion the research is readily available to everyone, I feel that like Tucker Carlson stated people should be able to make the choice on what they want to do with their bodies. If you would like to wear a mask, wear it. If you want the vaccine, get it, but I do not feel that anything should be forced upon the people that have the right to choose.\n",
            "There are many emotional and politically charged articles that depict if masks should be mandatory but, the purpose of them still remains. Most people comprehend the purpose of the mask but, do they understand that the mask is not just to protect them? The mask is to protect others, the people that are immunocompromised, children that don‚Äôt understand to keep their masks on, and people that are more susceptible to contracting the virus. Like I previously stated, there is a time and place to wear a mask. Our bodies need fresh air like Tucker Carlson stated we should not be wearing masks; I agree with this statement. People were not made to always have face coverings on, we need fresh air, so the less we wear masks the better. On the other hand, we do need to respect the fact that other people need our help. We need the human race to stick together for the future of the world.\n",

With the Covid-19 cases rising within the school district she feels as they are not doing enough to protect the well-being of the children. She had made the decision for her children to return to in person learning April of 2021 when Covid cases were declining and we had not received the backlash of the Delta Variant yet, masks were also still mandated in the school district at this time. With the CDC stating that Covid is more transmittable than even the common cold, and four months later the mask mandate had been lifted. With cases rising in Cobb County the school has updated their protocols, but they still have not mandated masks at this point.  In this article it is strongly stated that many Americans do not have the funds to deal with the repercussions the virus would hold for their families, especially families of color. The author of this article is very invested in this emotionally as her kids are at stake. This is where she connects with the reader; with quotes like ‚ÄúOur children are too important, their lives too full of promise, to continue in the way we are going.‚Äù Her claims are very strong and supported by strong reliable sources, I do feel as though this is more of an emotionally charged article as she fears for the safety of her children, and the community.\n",

When areas are lifting the mask mandates, as many are getting vaccinated, many are still choosing not to get vaccinated. This is allowing the Covid rates to rise again. There also lies the issue of which masks will work for this virus, and how to get people to wear them. There were studies compare the Covid epidemic to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic and how they had gotten number to drop. This was by making the item of protection appealing to the consumer. There are also studies to show normal cloth masks are not protective enough for people to wear.\n",

You then have the article by Tucker Carlson which states the masks are harming our bodies by keeping the toxins in, both of these arguments are very crucial.

Many people are scared and don‚Äôt know what to do especially when it comes to their health. You would think the most obvious answer would be to wear a mask, but when you have research showing that breathing in your own air all day is not good for you, what do you do? The purpose of a mask mandate is to keep yourself and the people around you healthy and to stop the spread of contractable disease, but if only some people are doing it and the when and where changes, does it really apply? In my opinion the research is readily available for everyone, I feel that like Tucker Carlson stated people should be able to make the choice on what they want to do with their bodies. If you would like to wear a mask, wear it. If you want the vaccine, get it, but I do not feel that anything should be forced upon the people that have the right to choose.\n",
            "There are many emotional and politically charged articles that depict on if masks should be mandatory but the purpose of them still remains. Most people comprehend the purpose of the mask but do they understand that the mask is not just to protect them? The mask is to protect others, the people that are immunocompromised, children that don‚Äôt understand to keep their masks on, and people that are more susceptible to contracting the virus. Like I previously stated, there is a time and place to wear a mask. Our bodies need fresh air like Tucker Carlson stated we should not be wearing masks; I agree with this statement. People were not made to have face coverings on at all times we need fresh air, so the less we wear masks the better. On the other hand, we do need to respect the fact that other people need our help we need the human race to stick together for the future of the world.\n",
            "In my personal opinion I recommend keeping your immune system up with taking the vitamins needed. I also recommend wearing a mask in public places such as schools, grocery stores, movie theaters etc. with that being said these people need to have frequent breaks from their masks to be able to breathe fresh air. As previously stated, this was how the flu of 1918 was able to subside their multiple waves, and able to help prevent many more deaths. So, do I think they should be mandatory? Yes, with respect to the human body.\n",

            "      The Fear Surrounding Climate Change\n",
            "From natural disasters to extreme weather Climate change is a relevant topic that is constantly being addressed by scientists and many concerned individuals. Despite all the concerned individuals and the demand for action, how warranted is the concern for climate change? While many feel scared there are others that feel as if climate change isn‚Äôt a relevant issue today.\n",
            "Climate change is a relevant topic that is constantly being addressed by scientists and many concerned individuals. Throughout time, the earth has experienced many different phases in terms of weather. These phases can be caused through natural forces from the sun or volcanic eruptions. Climate is the weather patterns of an area measured over years. Climate change refers to the change of these weather patterns, whether these conditions change in temperature or humidity.\n",
            "Another important aspect to consider in understanding climate change is that climate change is a long-term trend. Scientists are constantly analyzing these current climate conditions through satellites, ocean buoys and other advanced technologies. The scientists compare this data to past climate records that have been acquired through analyzing natural sources, such as tree rings, corals, and water sediments.\n",
            "A topic that is closely associated with climate change is global warming. While many would assume they discuss the same topic, global warming is one small aspect of climate change. NASA scientists claim that global warming is focused on the average global surface. Global warming is referencing only surface temperature, while climate change focuses on not only global warming but all other effects Earth is facing. There are other effects of climate change that can be as severe as global warming. Rising sea levels, polluted air extreme weather are all effects the earth faces from climate change. These changes in the climate can lead to environments changing, leading animals to adapt and change their habitats.\n",
            "As scientists are studying these changes, climate change continues to be a polarizing topic. Some people feel as if climate change shouldn‚Äôt be treated as a threat to society. They believe that climate scientists can make a difference, trusting that their research will impact the way we view climate change. However, others believe that climate change is an extreme threat to our environment and we should face the issues with the utmost urgency. They feel a great level of threat from climate change, compared to individuals who see little to no threat. An article from Pew Research Center believes that these different mindsets can lead to bias, with credibility being tied into political views and personal agendas. Despite these different views, climate change remains to be a relevant topic in the public eye.\n",
            "Facing the Facts\n",
            "As the discussion of climate change continues to gain popularity, many individuals fear the threats of climate change and feel a strong call to action. These strong feelings towards a diverse topic can lead to questions of credibility and create potential bias. Despite these problems, the author can engage the audience to look deeper into the diverse world of climate change, developing strong feelings towards one side of the argument.\n",
            "In an environmental article titled ‚ÄúGet scared: World‚Äôs Scientists Say Disastrous Climate Change is Here‚Äù from Zack Colman and Karl Mathiesen, the duo elaborates on how climate change has already caused natural disasters and will continue to lead to more. The authors continue to address climate change with the utmost urgency, using specific natural disasters as examples of humans interference with the natural ecosystem. They believe that the climate crisis is an upcoming threat with disastrous consequences, despite the widespread dismissal from politicians. The authors start the article with utmost urgency, stating that ‚Äúthe planet‚Äôs top scientists‚Äù have linked humans gas emissions to disastrous events. The article wastes no time to address their idea of relevant issues, while not providing a credible source for the first claim. Through using an urgent tone and nouns with negative connotations, such as disaster, it invites the audience to fear the future of climate change.\n",
            "The article also pushes the idea of fear not only through written elements but visual as well. Throughout the article there are multiple photos of wildfires, glaciers melting, natural disasters in third world countries, and even a video calling out to politicians. The photos are large high-resolution images taking up a large amount of screen space. By implanting these large grim images throughout the article, the authors can pick the visual elements the reader will refer to, instead of visualizing their own. In this case, the images can be seen as distressing to some, creating an uncomfortable mood in the article. And with a title ‚ÄúGet Scared‚Äù the authors clearly want the readers to associate climate change with disastrous events and deadly consequences of human intervention. By enforcing the claims with strong visual elements, credibility becomes lost and bias sneaks in as the authors try to create fear within the audience.\n",
            "Without using strong visual elements, the article ‚ÄúAre We Really Running Out of Time to Stop Climate Change?‚Äù, written by Rafi Letzter acknowledges climate change head on by discussing the consequences humans are currently facing. The author firmly believes that climate change is already taking hold, with many of its effects becoming irreversible as time goes on. The problems from climate change are not apocalyptic but can increasingly become harder to maintain. Letzter goes on to address how migrating and adaptation can be essential ways humans can combat the war on global climate change. By approaching climate change through a blunt claim, it allows readers to question their thoughts on the aspect of stopping climate change. Letzter continues to address climate change in a lighter tone but still emphasizes the importance of making a difference. The author creates this importance by showing the readers certain effects of climate change such as food production and diseases. These topics can create a sense of fear within the reader, due to the consequences of those effects.\n",
            "In contrast to these call-to-action articles, Michael Shellenberger, a writer for Forbes, addresses the stress and fear many people face when discussing climate change in the article ‚ÄúWhy Apocalyptic Claims About Climate Change Are Wrong‚Äù. Shellenberger believes that climate change should not be addressed with apocalyptic lingo, as they are unwarranted claims lacking credible sources. Shellenberger provides examples of apocalyptic claims made from relevant figures today. By using relevant figures, the audience can form a connection with these topics through previous knowledge. He continues to tell the audience that these claims are not credible and have no solid proof that climate change could lead to an ‚Äúextinction of the human species‚Äù. By doing so the article can approach a lighter tone, compared to the fearful mood conveyed in ‚ÄúGet Scared‚Äù, easing the reader to approach climate change in a different aspect. The author also finds other ways to ease the tension of worrisome apocalyptic claims, and the fear of future natural disasters. Shellenberger addresses how economic development has lowered the death toll from natural disasters. Providing a credible source, this allows the readers to approach natural disasters in a more manageable mindset.\n",
            "Unnecessary Fear\n",
            "Through analyzing the evidence and approaching the different claims, we can approach the question again. How concerned should we be about climate change? Should we fear climate change as far as describing the apocalypse, or should we approach the topic in a far lighter manner? Despite these diverse views, I find that climate change shouldn‚Äôt be feared or ignored. Instead of spending time spreading fear of climate change effects, the media should be educating the public in acknowledging what climate change is.\n",
            "By acknowledging climate change without all the fear and negative consequences, more people can discuss climate change and form their own understanding. Through describing climate change with an apocalyptic tone and using words with negative connotations, articles spend more time creating this fear than elaborating on the problem of climate change. Shellenberger addresses this sense of fear by stating ‚Äúno credible scientific body has ever said climate change threatens the collapse of civilization much less the extinction of the human species.‚Äù Without a credible source of evidence, these claims fall flat. While these claims serve a purpose to develop fear, people should base an understanding on credible sources that are backed by scientific evidence.\n",
            "These apocalyptic claims aim to create a call for action within the reader through fear. The problem with pursuing the reader with fear is that you create the same sense of fear towards acknowledging the problem. Instead of engaging the public to understand the topic of climate change, these articles and media outlets use threats of the future to push their ideas. In the article ‚ÄúGet Scared‚Äù the authors discuss the future of natural disasters due to the increasing threat of global warming. While the article brings several ideas that involve important aspects of climate change, such as increasing technological advances and significant political movements, they become lost as the authors use apocalyptic themes to capture the reader's attention. The importance of making a difference is motivated through fear, instead of focusing on actually making a difference.\n",
            "By ignoring these claims that lack the necessary evidence, we can approach the concern for climate change in a different manner. There should be a concern for climate change, but this concern should not be based on fear for the future. Through this we can focus primarily on the problem of climate change. When we start to focus primarily on the problem and acknowledge its consequences, we can prepare and develop solutions that will make a difference. Letzter addresses climate change less aggressively in his article but still maintains a strong support for combating climate change. Instead of mostly writing about the worrisome state many think our climate is in, Letzter spends time explaining how we can deal with the current problems or climate faces. The author understands that climate change won‚Äôt end the world but sitting by and watching won‚Äôt help either. There needs to be a call to action and a drive to fix things, without making false claims of the next doomsday.\n",
            "Climate change should be seen as an important problem with negative consequences. Less time should be spent on worrying the public and making biased claims that lack the necessary evidence. More time should be spent on education and allowing the public to understand why scientists are concerned. The concern is not based on the end of the world and other apocalyptic claims, rather than accepting the problem and understanding the less we do now the more we will have to do later down the road. People should be spreading awareness, not spreading fear to motivate the public in taking a stand.\n",

By approaching climate change through a blunt claim, it allows readers to question their thoughts on the aspect of stopping climate change. Letzter continues to address climate change in a lighter tone, but still emphasizes the importance of making a difference. The author creates this importance by showing the readers certain effects of climate change such as food production and diseases. These topics can create a sense of fear within the reader, due to the consequences of those effects.\n",
            "In contrast to these call-to-action articles, Michael Shellenberger, a writer for Forbes, addresses the stress and fear many people face when discussing climate change in the article ‚ÄúWhy Apocalyptic Claims About Climate Change Are Wrong‚Äù. Shellenberger believes that climate change should not be addressed with apocalyptic lingo, as they are unwarranted claims lacking credible sources. Shellenberger provides examples of apocalyptic claims made from relevant figures today. By using relevant figures, the audience can form a connection with these topics through previous knowledge. He continues to tell the audience that these claims are not credible and have no solid proof that climate change could lead to an ‚Äúextinction of the human species‚Äù. By doing so the article can approach a lighter tone, compared to the fearful mood conveyed in ‚ÄúGet Scared‚Äù, easing the reader to approach climate change in a different aspect. The author also finds other ways to ease the tension of worrisome apocalyptic claims, and the fear of future natural disasters. Shellenberger addresses how economic development has lowered the death toll from natural disasters. Providing a credible source, this allows the readers to approach natural disasters in a more manageable mindset.\n",
            "Synthesis\n",
            "Through analyzing the evidence and approaching the different claims, we can approach the question again. How concerned should we be about climate change? Should we fear climate change as far as describing the apocalypse, or should we approach the topic in a far lighter manner? Despite these diverse views, I find that climate change shouldn‚Äôt be feared or ignored. Instead of spending time spreading fear of climate change effects, the media should be educating the public in acknowledging what climate change is.\n",
            "By acknowledging climate change without all the fear and negative consequences, more people can discuss climate change and form their own understanding. Through describing climate change with an apocalyptic tone, and using words with negative connotations, articles spend more time creating this fear than elaborating on the problem of climate change. Shellenberger addresses this sense of fear by stating ‚Äúno credible scientific body has ever said climate change threatens the collapse of civilization much less the extinction of the human species.‚Äù Without a credible source of evidence, these claims fall flat. While these claims serve a purpose to develop fear, people should base an understanding on credible sources that are backed by scientific evidence.\n",
            "These apocalyptic claims aim to create a call for action within the reader through fear. The problem with pursuing the reader with fear, is that you create the same sense of fear towards acknowledging the problem. Instead of engaging the public to understand the topic of climate change, these articles and media outlets use threats of the future to push their ideas. In the article ‚ÄúGet Scared‚Äù the authors discuss the future of natural disasters due to the increasing threat of global warming. While the article brings several ideas that involve important aspects of climate change, such as increasing technological advances and significant political movements, they become lost as the authors use apocalyptic themes to capture the reader's attention. The importance of making a difference is motivated through fear, instead of focusing on actually making a difference.\n",
            "By ignoring these claims that lack the necessary evidence, we can approach the concern for climate change in a different manner. There should be a concern for climate change, but this concern should not be based on fear for the future. Through this we can focus primarily on the problem of climate change. When you start to focus primarily on the problem and acknowledge its consequences, we can prepare and develop solutions that will make a difference. Letzter addresses climate change less aggressively in his article, but still maintains a strong support for combating climate change. Instead of mostly writing about the worrisome state many think our climate is in, Letzter spends time explaining how we can deal with the current problems or climate faces. The author understands that climate change won‚Äôt end the world, but sitting by and watching won‚Äôt help either. There needs to be a call to action and a drive to fix things, without making false claims of the next doomsday.\n",
            "Climate change should be seen as an important problem with negative consequences. Less time should be spent on worrying the public and making biased claims that lack the necessary art evidence. More time should be spent on education and allowing the public to understand why scientists are concerned. The concern is not based on the end of the world and other apocalyptic claims, rather than accepting the problem and understanding the less we do now, the more we will have to do later down the road. People should be spreading awareness, not spreading fear to motivate the public in taking a stand.\n",

            "      Mask Mandate Purpose\n",
            "Coronavirus has been around since 1965. However, in 2019 a different strand formed, leaving us with this new virus. No one had any idea in 2019 what we would be getting our selves into. Covid-19 is considered a pandemic because it spread to several countries affecting a lot of people. This is where you start seeing mandates for mask across the country. Chris Danner Intelligencer, say the CDC recommends everyone to mask up again. Doesn‚Äôt mater if you have had the vaccine or not. Children returning to in person learning needs to mask up as well. The numbers of the virus are going up. The new Delta variant is the main reason cases are on the rise again.\n",
            "According to wikipedia, the first mask mandate was announced April 2020. It was recommended that people wore them in places with close contact to others where social distancing couldn‚Äôt be maintained. Wearing a mask would help lessen the spread of the virus from person to person, especially those who are a symptomatic. Public health expert,¬†Larry Gostin¬†stated that federal officials should have recommended mask-wearing sooner. When Covid-19 hit originally, the government did not recommend the use of mask outside of medical personal. The government said that proper hygiene and getting the flu vaccine would do its part in keeping the spread of covid down. Later in March 2020 the CDC released a recommendation that masks should be used by people who are sick and people who are caring for someone sick. They also discouraged the use of a mask for the general public.\n",
            "Jessica McDonald the evolving science of face masks stated that Benjamin Cowling from the University of Hong Kong, said that using mask had a good effect on transmission. He said that mask use alone wasn‚Äôt enough to reduce the transmission. Other experts remain skeptical with using masks especially the ones people use today, not the N95 ones the hospital uses. They said that mask can reduce transmission of the virus because you are not breathing in the respiratory droplets that are exposed when we breath normally.\n",
            "Wearing masks along with social distancing, and washing hands would reduce the transmission is what Bridget Balch is saying The science and psychology behind masking to prevent the spread of COVID-19 | AAMC. While people are not complying with the mask mandate the numbers of infected people are rising again. Understanding why people don‚Äôt want to have a mask mandate is critical in understanding how people think and act. People feel it is against their rights or freedoms to be made to wear a mask in public.\n",
            "According to Lynne Peeples in her article, she doesn‚Äôt talk about her personal option of a mask mandate. Instead Peeples uses scientist when talking about mask mandates. Peeples talks about the science behind wearing a mask, and how it prevents the spread of droplets in the air. Klaus Walde and his team concluded that if we wear a face mask it reduces the spread of Covid-19 by 40%.\n",
            "Peeples talks about Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen who works for the public health scientist at the University of Oxford, UK, talks about how mask can be scary and not sexy. Everything people learned from mask came from the medical field.  ‚ÄúCloth masks and associated fashion brought playfulness and an everyday feeling to mask wearing. That contributed to its acceptability,‚Äù says Helene.\n",
            "Tucker Carlson with Fox News has his own disapproval for mask mandates. Carlson has a very political stance on the mask mandate. He makes it know from the very first paragraph what a strong leader is and what a weak leader is. He uses these to paint a picture of how Carlson perceives the mask mandate. He talks about how the Biden‚Äôs administration increased the covid restrictions across the country. Carlson even talked about how children had to wear masks in school. Carlson gives his opinion of the Biden administration, and his dislike. So for a reader to be reading this article it might be a red flag if you like the Biden administration, or it might be a positive if you disagree with the Biden administration.\n",
            "Carlson doesn‚Äôt give any good supporting evidence of why a mask mandate wouldn‚Äôt work. He just keeps making puns at the Biden administration. When he talks about children having to wear a mask and how it is more dangerous then Covid-19, there is no scientific proof. Without proof it is just a man making an option.\n",
            "While Carlson‚Äôs article is mere option and not facts, one may not want to read it. As a reader you are wanting to know the science behind the mandate, not just one‚Äôs option. If the reader wanted someone‚Äôs option, all they would have to do is ask. This article is not for someone who wants scientific proof why a mandate is good or bad.\n",
            "Maureen Downey, with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, talks about not having face masks mandates. A former teacher, Charis Granger-Mbugua fears sending her two young kids to school in a district that doesn‚Äôt require wearing mask. Her children attend Cobb now where she is a teacher at. Cobb school district started school with a policy encouraging masks, however it was not required. Cobb and another school are the only two in the district that allow staff and students to wear mask.\n",
            "As a Mother Downey just wants to protect her children from the chance of getting Covid-19. Most people who read this article will find it bias based on a mother wanting to protect her children. Which if you don‚Äôt have children, you probably wouldn‚Äôt understand her cries. Her article is very opinionated for a mask mandate. Downey talked about returning to school and how excited they all should be, but she just can‚Äôt find it in her. Schools are letting parents choose if they wear a mask, however teachers are being told they can‚Äôt wear one. So, then once again we are exposing everyone to covid. For Downey she just wanted to know she had the ability to wear a mask. To help keep her protected. To help protect her children. As a reader if you are wanting science and unbiased facts this would not be the answer for you.\n",
            "Each article had its own agenda. Weather it was to inform or give a bias option. Reading Peeples article, she had a lot of science in her article. She gave great informed information. Nothing about what she said was bias. If someone needs facts to make an informed decision Peeples is the article I would suggest reading.\n",
            "The question is, what is the purpose of a mask mandate, can be answered by so many reactions, one could have a neutral opinion while others have a very opinionated answer. Like Carlson, he blamed the Biden administration for everything. Even though he blamed them, he still didn‚Äôt use any facts to back up his opinions. Everything you read there is how he feels. If you lack power people won‚Äôt listen to you or do what you say. This is true if you think about it. People of power say jump and you say how high. I think Carlson was only trying to prove that point in the matter. He didn‚Äôt do a very good job at giving science any thought though. While he was very opinionated about the Biden administration he is worried about our children and having to wear a mask for school. It‚Äôs great to hear how concerned he is for our children, but what about science? Where are the facts that he said, ‚Äúdespite the scientifically established fact that masks pose a far greater threat to children than COVID does.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see any facts stated. Like I said I am grateful he is concerned for our children, but facts would have helped back his statement up.\n",
            "As you read Downey‚Äôs article, you see where she is a mom and has her opinion of a mask mandate. How she feels wearing mask will protect her and her children. Once again, she didn‚Äôt use science. These are her opinions. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Downey decision to change schools that allow teachers and students to wear mask was entirely up to her.  No one forced her hand. She wanted to do what was best for her and her children. She stated, ‚Äúthat having her 4-year-old wear a mask was the hard choice and it had to be done to protect her.‚Äù That is an option that all parents have. We get to decide if our children will be wearing mask in school settings. As parents we need to be able to make informed choices for our children. No one is going to fight for the children harder than their parents.\n",
            "As we learn how to deal with the different effects that are happening with Covid-19 and the different strains, we must be able to adapt. We must change when things change to still have a life. Our kids need us to make the best-informed decisions for them too. Our elders need us to do what is right, so they don‚Äôt end up alone. Wearing a mask is just a phase, at some point in time this too will be nothing but a vague memory.\n",
            "So, asking the question once more, what is the purpose of a mask mandate? A mask mandate is enforced by the government. They say how long you must wear one. Does it interfere with our constitutional rights? Yes, but that is not why a mask mandate could work. It could lower the spread of infection to others. If someone is a-sympathetic and walking around the store with no mask, they are just spreading germs to others. How many others, who knows? A mask mandate is just someone trying to look out for the greater good of everyone. Is it hard to follow a mask mandate, yes? We are human and love see others faces. We, humans don‚Äôt adapt well to change. A mask mandate could lessen the curve like the government has been saying for months, but it takes a lot of people to do it and enforce a mandate. As a human we are our own advocates for what we want and need. If we fail to advocate for what we need, no one knows. Wearing a mask could very well be for the greater good.\n",

She talked with a business owner who had signs on their doors about mask. The had to take the one sign down, because they didn‚Äôt feel they should be asking customers if they are fully vaccinated. The usage of mask will continue for the pandemic. Researchers are trying to understand what the science is behind the virus to encourage people to wear mask. Scientists around the world are evaluating the data and asking questions on what makes some policies effective and other not. How can they get people to keep wearing mask to protect others? Will there be anything other thing that we can do to keep people safe?\n",
            "Tucker Carlson with Fox News has his own options. According to one‚Äôs power stance will decide how people follow. Biden‚Äôs administration increased the covid restrictions across the country. Children had to wear masks in school. They forced masks on adults even the adults who had been vaccinated. We were told that if we got the vaccine, you would be able to go back to living your lives, but that was a lie. Now we must keep wearing masks. People of power are the ones making the decision to what we can and can‚Äôt do. Do they get to keep making our minds up for us or do we finally get to stand up for what we believe in?\n",
            "People of power make decisions of the people. The Biden administration is staying that everyone needs the shot. If we had a rational public health policy it would work differently. If you got the shot you got the shot, if you didn‚Äôt have one you still went on with your life. It would like the world was free again, not owned by the government. The government is using Covid 19 as a ploy to make people scared, pass blame. They are trying to get people separated of vaccine vs not vaccinated. People who question wither to get the vaccine or not are being attacked if they don‚Äôt get it and something happens. We all have a right to make the best decision for ourselves. The government shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to tell anyone what they should put into their own bodies. That should be a personal choice. How do you put a mandate on something? Understanding the science behind wearing a face mask would help people be better informed. Wearing one just because the government told you too isn‚Äôt all that it is. Wearing one will protect you from droplets in the air that give someone the virus. Wearing a mask protects those around you if you are a-symptomatic with the virus.\n",
            "Maureen Downey, with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, talks about not having face masks mandates. A former teacher, Charis Granger-Mbugua fears sending her two young kids to school in a district that doesn‚Äôt require wearing mask. Her children attend Cobb now where she is a teacher at. Cobb school district started school with a policy encouraging masks, however it was not required. Cobb and another school are the only two in the district that allow staff and students to wear mask.\n",
            "Starting a new school should be a very exciting time in a child‚Äôs life. However, that start of this year was from exciting. It was filled with fear, worry, guilt, anger, frustration. Children went almost a year of virtual learning and having to return to the unknown of a classroom setting is alarming. The new variant of Covid-19 is proving to be much more. According to the CDC the delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, common colds, smallpox, flu. People want to encourage in person learning while keeping children safe. As a parent all anyone wants is to keep their children safe while they go to school to learn.

            "      Mask Mandate Purpose\n",
            "Coronavirus has been around since 1965. However, in 2019 a different strand formed, leaving us with this new virus. No one had any idea in 2019 what we would be getting our selves into. Covid-19 is considered a pandemic because it spread to several countries affecting a lot of people. This is where you start seeing mandates for mask across the country. Chris Danner Intelligencer, say the CDC recommends everyone to mask up again. Doesn‚Äôt mater if you have had the vaccine or not. Children returning to in person learning needs to mask up as well. The numbers of the virus are going up. The new Delta variant is the main reason cases are on the rise again.\n",
            "According to wikipedia, the first mask mandate was announced April 2020. It was recommended that people wore them in places with close contact to others where social distancing couldn‚Äôt be maintained. Wearing a mask would help lessen the spread of the virus from person to person, especially those who are a symptomatic. Public health expert,¬†Larry Gostin¬†stated that federal officials should have recommended mask-wearing sooner. When Covid-19 hit originally, the government did not recommend the use of mask outside of medical personal. The government said that proper hygiene and getting the flu vaccine would do its part in keeping the spread of covid down. Later in March 2020 the CDC released a recommendation that masks should be used by people who are sick, people who are caring for someone sick. They also discouraged the use of a mask for the general public.\n",
            "Jessica McDonald the evolving science of face masks stated that Benjamin Cowling from the University of Hong Kong, said that using mask had a good effect on transmission. He said that mask use alone wasn‚Äôt enough to reduce the transmission. Other experts remain skeptical with using masks especially the ones people use today, not the N95 ones the hospital uses. They said that mask can reduce transmission of the virus because you are not breathing in the respiratory droplets that are exposed when we breath normally.\n",
            "Wearing masks along with social distancing, and washing hands would reduce the transmission is what Bridget Balch is saying The science and psychology behind masking to prevent the spread of COVID-19 | AAMC. While people are not complying with the mask mandate the numbers of infected people are rising again. Understanding why people don‚Äôt want to have a mask mandate is critical in understanding how people think and act. People feel it is against their rights or freedoms to be made to wear a mask in public.\n",
            "According to Lynne Peeples in her article, she doesn‚Äôt talk about her personal option of a mask mandate. Instead Peeples uses scientist when talking about mask mandates. Peeples talks about the science behind wearing a mask, and how it prevents the spread of droplets in the air. Klaus Walde and his team concluded that if we wear a face mask it reduces the spread of Covid-19 by 40%.\n",
            "Peeples talks about Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen who works for the public health scientist at the University of Oxford, UK, talks about how mask can be scary and not sexy. Washing a mask, what is the proper temperature, time. Everything people learned from mask came from the medical field.  ‚ÄúCloth masks and associated fashion brought playfulness and an everyday feeling to mask wearing. That contributed to its acceptability,‚Äù says Helene.\n",
            "Tucker Carlson with Fox News has his own disapproval for mask mandates. Carlson has a very political stance on the mask mandate. He makes it know from the very first paragraph what a strong leader is and what a weak leader is. He uses these to paint a picture of how Carlson perceives the mask mandate. He talks about how the Biden‚Äôs administration increased the covid restrictions across the country. Carlson even talked about how children had to wear masks in school. Carlson gives his option of the Biden administration, and his dislike. So for a reader to be reading this article it might be a red flag if you like the Biden administration, or it might be a positive if you disagree with the Biden administration.\n",
            "Carlson doesn‚Äôt give any good supporting evidence of why a mask mandate wouldn‚Äôt work. He just keeps making puns at the Biden administration. When he talks about children having to wear a mask and how it is more dangerous then Covid-19, there is no scientific proof. Without proof it is just a man making an option.\n",
            "While Carlson‚Äôs article is mere option and not facts, one may not want to read it. As a reader you are wanting to know the science behind the mandate, not just one‚Äôs option. If the reader wanted someone‚Äôs option, all they would have to do is ask. This article is not for someone who wants scientific proof why a mandate is good or bad.\n",
            "Maureen Downey, with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, talks about not having face masks mandates. A former teacher, Charis Granger-Mbugua fears sending her two young kids to school in a district that doesn‚Äôt require wearing mask. Her children attend Cobb now where she is a teacher at. Cobb school district started school with a policy encouraging masks, however it was not required. Cobb and another school are the only two in the district that allow staff and students to wear mask.\n",
            "As a Mother Downey just wants to protect her children from the chance of getting Covid-19. Most people who read this article will find it bias based on a mother wanting to protect her children. Which if you don‚Äôt have children, you probably wouldn‚Äôt understand her cries. Her article is very opinionated for a mask mandate. Downey talked about returning to school and how excited they all should be, but she just can‚Äôt find it in her. Schools are letting parents choose if they wear a mask, however teachers are being told they can‚Äôt wear one. So, then once again we are exposing everyone to covid. For Downey she just wanted to know she had the ability to wear a mask. To help keep her protected. To help protect her children. As a reader if you are wanting science and unbiased facts this would not be the answer for you.\n",
            "Each article had its own agenda. Weather it was to inform or give a bias option. Reading Peeples article, she had a lot of science on her article. She gave great informed information. Nothing about what she said was bias. If someone needs facts to make an informed decision Peeples is the article I would suggest reading.\n",
            "The question is, what is a mask mandate, can be answered by so many reactions, one could have a neutral option while others have a very opinionated answer. Like Carlson blamed the Biden administration for everything. Even though he blamed them, he still didn‚Äôt use any facts to back his option up. Everything you read there is how he feels. If you lack power people won‚Äôt listen to you or do what you say. This is true if you think about it. People of power say jump and you say how high. I think Carlson was only trying to prove that point in the matter. He didn‚Äôt do a very good job at giving science any thought though.\n",
            "As you read Downey‚Äôs article, you see where she is a mom and has her options of a mask mandate. How she feels wearing mask will protect her and her children. Once again, she didn‚Äôt use science. These are her options. Everyone is entitled to their own options. Downey decision to change schools that allow teachers and students to wear mask was entirely up to her. No one forced her hand. She wanted to do what was best for her.\n",
            "As we learn how to deal with the different effects that are happening with Covid-19 and the different strains, we must be able to adapt. We must change when things change to still have a life. Our kids need us to make the best-informed decisions for them too. Our elders need us to do what is right, so they don‚Äôt end of alone. Wearing a mask is just a phase, at some point in time this too will be nothing but a vague memory.\n",
            "So, asking the question once more, what is a mask mandate? A mask mandate is enforced by the government. They say how long you must wear one. Does it interfere with our constitutional rights? Yes, but that is not why a mask mandate could work. It could lower to spread of infection to others. If someone is a-sympathetic and walking around the store with no mask, they are just spreading germs to others. How many others, who knows? A mask mandate is just someone trying to look out for the greater good of everyone. Is it hard to follow a mask mandate, yes? We are human and love see others faces. We, humans don‚Äôt adapt well to change.\n",

            "      The Purpose of Mask Mandates\n",
            "Unfortunately, the year 2019 is known as the year of quarantine. Additionally, the year 2020 is known for the start of mask mandates. Although the controversial topic has been popular for some time now, mandatory mask mandates have been enforced within the past year due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. At first, the public was confused about the new virus. A year later, the public questioned governmental enforcement regarding the mask mandate.\n",
            "The mask mandate refers to the authoritative governmental policy of wearing a mask in certain settings when out in public. Recently, with declines in COVID-19 cases and the option of vaccines, the mask mandate has been lifted and altered within certain situations. In this paper, it is important to know the difference between a mandate and recommendation. Enforcement is the key difference, this will be explained later in detail. As a controversial topic, the main sides that divide this issue refer to the compliance and non-compliance of the mask mandate.\n",
            "Unfortunately, this turn in society had many questioning the purpose and well as the authority. The noncompliant side questions the true effectiveness of the mask mandate. The viral disease was new with few studies to provide accurate and desperately needed answers to oftenly sought questions. From the beginning, everyone was given information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was told to follow their guidelines. However, many realized that the CDC guidance is not an enforceable mandate  but rather a recommendation that officials make in hopes for the public to utilize. This realization led to the questioning of the governmental authority of enforcing the mandate, referring to the breach of constitutional rights.  Although there are many claims, the main one that is often brought up is the violation of the constitution‚Äôs First Amendment. This side, more often than not, implies that the mask mandate ‚Äúrepresents forced political expression‚Äù since no specific federal law exists regarding the matter.\n",
            "Contrary, the compliant side refers to those who oblige to the mask mandate, wearing masks where it is indicated. This side often fears the consequences of not complying, such as contracting the virus or spreading it to loved ones. In return, the compliance in this case ties connection to the purpose of the mask mandate. The overall purpose is to reduce transmission of communicable disease. Statistically, noticeable declines were present with the implementation of masks in not only county level cases but also death rates. This side, as opposed to the other, recognizes that although no specific laws might exist, current public health laws encourage and empower the mask mandate.\n",
            "Although there are many approachable sides to the heated and debatable topic, one thing is certain. Mask mandating has undoubtedly created a divide in society. Due to a high demand for answers, sources are being evaluated and pulled from anywhere and everywhere. A question in this circumstance to consider is how reliable and accurate is data? Similar to other health policies and policies in general, many sources are being found with many contradicting one another. Which one the reader and the majority of the public sides with is based on how accurate and influential the informational comes off.\n",
            "According to Nature‚Äôs news feature on what science says about lifting mask mandates, the lifting of the mask mandate has moved too fast. A claim is that public comfortableness affects the decision on whether or not the majority chooses to follow regulations. A key factor in addressing this issue is introducing the mandate in a quick action. Research supports this action by mentioning how a city in Germany was able to drop COVID-19 cases a miraculous 75% in just 20 days of implementation. This suggestion is further supported through the realization of how China quickly adopted the mask mandate and most likely led to the prevention of a large-scale spread of the disease. A considerable point made to question the effectiveness of the mandate, questions if the United States would have seen a further deduction in COVID rates if the national mandate was implemented earlier on. Unfortunately, no evidence can support the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù since no research at the time was conducted in relation to the implementation placed afterwards. The tone throughout the article is suggestive of being cautious with unmasking. The author includes current stances on business owners and their level of comfortableness on the unmasking ordeal. The core explanation on the issue is based on a majority of businesses finding the unmasking order now cautious because it feels invasive to identify if every customer walking in is vaccinated. This message issue of some business still requiring masks has also stirred a commotion. The overall message conveyed in this article implies that a majority of people still fear the aftermath of unmasking.\n",
            "In an alternative view, according to the Fox News source, no one is fighting for the rights of those who don't want the COVID vaccine. There is a clear angry tone with a passion for self rights. Comparisons are being drawn between what is strong and weak. The recent Biden administration is described as weak. The mask mandate is reflected off of weak leadership in terms of living in terror and ruling by force due to having no choice. Mandating masks comes off as an irrational command. This message comes across as something crucial that needs to be recognized for the sake of human rights. The way the author conveys the message and tone implies a loud and noticeable action is necessary to stand against the mandate. Another strong term usage used in the article refers to being ‚Äú a rational person‚Äù and having ‚Äúsane leaders‚Äù. A claim this article makes is that the government needs no medical justification for their determination. The public is to either obey or ‚Äúnews sources will call you a murder‚Äù if it is questioned. According to the Fox News source, this is how our government works. However, contrary to this claim, there is no available evidence to support it. In other words, the demand for mandatory vaccines and masks is not lightly taken especially in connection to public health. Although there are demands that this is only about politics and social control, with governmental ownership of the body, no evidence supports this opinionated claim.\n",
            "Contrary to the statements above, according to the Journal-Constitution source, mask mandates need to be a requirement in schools. There is a concerning tone over parents fearing the safety of their children. The argument that is COVID-19 mainly targets the elderly and adults is shut down. A pediatric recommendation provides insight on how it is not innocuous to children, through introduction of possible end results of more susceptibility to life altering diseases after recovery. Although a healthcare professional is a great source when discussing health issues, no actual research evidence is provided to support this recommendation. There is a sense of guilt tripping through the usage of ‚Äúwhat if'' and ‚Äúwhat then‚Äù. Considerations are made to imagine the unchangeable negative impacts in upcoming years and the guilt of not having done early interventions. Although this is a possibility, there is no evidence to support what the future holds for anyone. The children are viewed as endangered with no choice. Suggestions imply that the general public should make the right choices, sacrifice personal comfort and preferences, and listen to the experts such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization. Both of these health experts support the recommendation of universal masking for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status, to keep children safe.\n",
            "One factor playing a major role in this issue is culture. The culture of a community and society helps identify what is normal and what is not. Since the start of the pandemic, communities have been altered and divided due to the implementation of new changes (mask mandates) that were implemented rather quickly. Social trends are now showing that this change, although it has it‚Äôs negatives also has some positives. Cultural change is showing to aid in addressing public uneasiness and cautiousness. The adaptation to mask mandates is becoming less and less unusual. Through familiarization, the idea is that the general public will become more comfortable wearing masks willingly. Respectfully, any new introduction to a change is not taken lightly, the mask mandate is just one of many. It is suggested that over time, the adaptation of masks will come easy through cultural comfortableness.\n",
            "However, masked or unmasked, the reality is the issue is controversial. Mask mandates were enforced for the purpose of protecting people. This enforcement that was initially intended for a reduction in the health crisis but is now being viewed as an increase in governmental control. Understandably so, people have the right to fear. The question is which fear overpowers the other? The fear of the government controlling our rights or the fear of contracting a viral disease with a potential deadly consequence. The phrase ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù can be implemented on both sides of the argument but how safe can one be if they‚Äôre unknowingly contracting a communicable disease? This fear not only affects one‚Äôs self rather it extends to loved ones, such as children.\n",
            "Currently, vaccinated individuals are not required to wear a mask. The mask mandate has been lifted with the exception of some businesses still having the right to remain masked. A valid argumentative point is why do these businesses still remain masked when the government declared that mask mandates are no longer required? The biggest comparison between these two sides is fear. One side fears the noncompliance resulting in the increase of health risks. The other side fears that forceful compliance implies that the government has the right to control basic human rights. The biggest issue is finding common ground  which can be difficult when looking at both sides. If an individual no longer feels the need to wear a mask and believes their right should be respected then the same concept applies to the business that believes it's their right to still implement mask mandates. Ultimately, both sides have rights and both sides feel the need to be respected. However, respect will not always grant you access to situations.\n",
            "When looking at data, statistics have overall proven that mask mandates have decreased the rate of coronavirus cases. The results from these statistics have correlation to the purpose which was to reduce transmission. In regards to governmental control and the overpowering of basic human rights, currently no specific laws exist that support this stance. In addition, although there are demands that mask mandates are only about politics and social control, with governmental ownership of the body, there is no concrete evidence supporting this. Therefore, statements related to this are categorized out as an opinionated claim. A fact is that current public health laws do encourage the mask mandate for general public safety. However, these public health laws focus on maintaining the health of the general public, not constricting their rights. Whether this controversial issue is viewed from a health or political view, one thing remains clear. The purpose of mask mandating is to reduce transmission of communicable disease in hopes of protecting the general public.\n",
